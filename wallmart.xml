You have the same mac n cheese from the box in less than 5 minutes, and in individual portions.
I use it to feed my toddler since it saves me time, and a whole box would go to waste.</value><value>Cheesy, cream and great taste!  Only Mac</value><value>I got these for my son. He loves them. Tastes great, easy to make, no mess.</value><value>The food is okay the delivery sucks buy a four pack of mac cheese and I was delivered one cup</value><value>This is so good when you just need something.</value><value>Need I say more; these Easy Mac cups rock. From shelf to table in three minutes.</value><value>So easy and tasty, me and my son both liked them alot. I just ordered a few more.</value><value>Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese 4 pack is a very good lunch pack to have at my desk and it store will</value><value>I send these to my daughter in college. She pops them in the microwave and loves them!</value><value>I thoroughly enjoy all the various flavors of Kraft mac and cheese Deluxe dinners with the sealed pouch of cheese that is added to the noodles after they are cooked.  This item was tried for the convenience of a quick cooking time of only 3.5 minutes.  What a disappointment.  The flavor is horrible.  In fact ... there is actually no flavor to speak of.  A small lump of noodles covered in a binder of some sort.  If you are hungry ... and you probably are at lunch or dinner time ... that hunger will remain after eating one of these meals.  A serving contains 2.05 ounces of mac and cheese.  This serving of mac and cheese amounted to 8 tablespoons of food.  Yes, I took the time to count the amount food in the second container after eating the meager portion of the first container.  This product may satisfy the hunger of a small child but not one a 44 year old man.  I suggest you say 'NO" to this product and purchase the Kraft Deluxe mac and cheese meals.</value><value>I think these little dinners are great for kids but not necessarily for adults. It has a okay taste and if you need something fast, then they're fine.</value><value>I like the taste and so easy for a single person to whip up!  Something that may be helpful to those on a low salt diet,  the salt is in with the dry macaroni and can be shaken off or out of the cup before adding the water, if you so desire. It does taste like the original Kraft macaroni and cheese you buy in the box!</value><value>Kraft mac &amp; cheese is the best mac &amp; cheese ever. Its very easy to make and I instructions are pretty straightforward I believe it takes about three minutes to make this mac &amp; cheese and it has really amazing flavor. Its really affordable and I do recommend you trying it</value><value>so even though this does not have the actual cheese, and it's powder is actually really, really good, I eat this as often as I can, and there's nothing to improve the product, it's overall good, and it's easy to prepare. I would buy it again and I've definitely recommend</value><value>This microwaveable version is quite good but I feel like it is not as good as the ones that you actually have to boil the noodles and add the cheese powder as well as the butter as well or margarine I feel like in general heart is very basic but you can always spice it up with your own ingredients and make it better.</value><value>Super quick and affordable! Easy instructions that are easy to follow. Great snack for when I was in college and needed to have a quick lunch in between classes. Flavour was amazing and always just added a bit of milk and extra cheese to make it more cheesier and creamier!</value><value>Kraft Macaroni and Cheese is the perfect part to a healthy, balanced lifestyle! I have never been too far from my Kraft and it is incredible for any meal. Add some hot dogs, or some extra milk, or double the flavor packets.  Kraft Macaroni and Cheese is simply the greatest and easiest meal for a cheap mother trying to please four picky children.</value><value>These are easy for on the go. They arent super filling, so sometimes I will treat them as a snack more than a meal. They are fast cooking in the microwave, but I must warn you that you will most likely burn your tongue while eating this unless you wait forever.</value><value>Mac and cheese are probably the one food item that will ALWAYS be found in my pantry because without it, my children would riot.  This particular product is probably my go to life saver when my son is insisting on mac and cheese but I just don't have the time to make a full box on the stove.  Its one of the easiest things you can make and comes together in less than 5 minutes.  The flavor isn't quite as good as making the full box with milk and butter (or margarine) but the kids don't care so I don't care.  My only complaint is that it isn't as cost effective as buying the boxes but the quick preparation and convenience can't be beat.</value><value>I love these little easy mac's for on the go. They are super easy and quick to make, with only needing water and a microwave. They dont taste quite as good as regular mac n cheese, but you sacrifice that for the easy cooking that this comes with. Great choice when needing a quick meal.</value></reviewer_comment><reviewed_date><value>February 14, 2013</value><value>April 22, 2020</value><value>April 2, 2020</value><value>April 23, 2020</value><value>April 25, 2020</value><value>August 18, 2011</value><value>August 4, 2013</value><value>November 28, 2012</value><value>November 15, 2013</value><value>April 18, 2020</value><value>January 10, 2014</value><value>January 5, 2017</value><value>March 29, 2020</value><value>March 30, 2020</value><value>April 6, 2020</value><value>April 4, 2020</value><value>April 18, 2020</value><value>March 31, 2020</value><value>March 30, 2020</value><value>March 31, 2020</value></reviewed_date></item>

Super easy even for a preteen.  It's hard to mess up.  I wouldn't call them healthy, but they are better than some other options they could choose.  In 5 min they can have this made and can stop standing in front of the open fridge.</value><value>Ingrediants are good enough. My son likes it!</value><value>So easy to prepare. Tastes good and the kids love it.</value><value>This product is well worth the money. Excellent taste and portioned well. Easy to prepare.</value><value>These are great for kids or anyone needing a portable lunchbox even snack. Do I think it is a healthy option, but  it could be worse. Sometimes the pull tab lid doesnt rip off perfectly well. That is annoying but overall not bad.  Sometimes it does have too much of a fake taste .</value><value>I remember those days when I didn't know how to cook and I got home from school and there was nothing to eat yet. This was my every day meal that I would make myself to wait for my mom to get home and cook dinner. Super unhealthy but super good tase. I would try not to buy them again</value><value>These are awesome! I love having these at home as Im a mom and when your little ones are hungry after school these are the easiest and filling thing they love to eat. Very convenient and delicious! I even love eating these myself when I need a quick fix. Recommend to all my parents out there.</value><value>This is perfect for anyone, especially kids, when youre rushing around. They easily pop in the microwave and they taste delicious! It is also a good portion size. I would recommend this to anyone but especially for anyone who has kids running around.</value><value>fantastic, beautiful, tasty, creamy, yummy, hits the spot. its cheap, it has easy to follow instructions with ingredients you probably already have in your house (milk/butter) I buy these all the time for a yummy lunch or with hot dogs for dinner. love these!</value><value>Okay.  Who does NOT like macaroni and cheese?  This one in particular has good and bad reviews from me.  Same great flavor and very easy to prepare.  There just is NOT enough.  Price is also a tad bit high but worth it if you factor in the time you save.</value><value>The original KD is a hit in my house. Its a great easy alternative for a side dish with dinner or even on its own. We have it for lunch too. Sometimes we even like cutting up hotdogs and putting it in. Sounds gross but trust me!!! Its good. I dont really like the cups. I prefer the original boxed kind.</value><value>These are my go-to! I love them. Theyre very easy to make as you just add water and you put them in the product. I havent had them in awhile but when I do get them, Ill eat them a few times a month, Theyre a nice treat for me since I am lactose intolerant; it really does remind me of my childhood. The only thing I do wish is that they have a slightly bigger size you can purchase. I usually need to eat 2-3 of these to really feel satisfied.</value><value>Super convenient and one of my favorite late night snacks. super cheesy and same old delicious kraft that we all know and love. its not very expensive either and its a great deal for the serving size.. YES I am over satisfied with this product  Kraft Easy Mac Original</value><value>Theres something about being able to cook your food in the microwave that isnt great but this right here is delightful. Its so good and you can even eat it as a quick snack. I think its practical and why not purchase a few microwaveable bowls of Mac!</value><value>I ate these all the time when I was younger. I think craft is a basic Mac classic. It is amazing, but it is not disgusting. I think now that im older, I do prefer other mac and cheeses such as white cheddar. I think this Mac and Cheese dinner is a classic and something everyone enjoys once in awhile.</value><value>This meal is a classic. Lunch, dinner, heck maybe even breakfast. When I reflect on my childhood, I think about Kraft mac &amp; cheese. I looked forward to making it, and enjoyed every bite too. You can never go wrong with Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese. Its a staple in my pantry.</value><value>Okay so, I used to live off this stuff in college. And I remember it being SO yummy. However I just recently made one these again, ya know, to relive the old days and wow. Its absolutely awful. Not only is the portion extremely small (maybe a normal portion for some but my appetite is endless so keep that in mind) but the cheese never fully melts into the creamy texture, leaving tiny little powdery cheese balls hidden in your Mac. Overall, these will keep you alive in a pinch, but keep your expectations low.</value><value>When i was little i loved this. It was a quick and easy way for me to eat, because i was a picky eater. I also eat now as i am older i am in college so it is a quick snack to have something in my stomach. The only thing that would make it better is if they added more cheese.</value><value>I love these little Mac n cheese instant cups!! Specially when you have little ones and you want to make a fast yummy lunch or dinner for them! Ive used these for all of my kids when they were little and even now they they are bigger lol
These actually bring memories back. They are delicious, easy and quick to make!! Microwave is the way!</value><value>I like the original box of Kraft mac n cheese, but these just don't taste the same and not in a good way. I'm also not a fan of the texture as it stay a lot more liquidy than I feel like it should. If you want it to have a better, thicker mac n cheese texture you have to microwave it a lot longer than it says on the cup</value></reviewer_comment><reviewed_date><value>March 29, 2020</value><value>May 29, 2014</value><value>January 12, 2014</value><value>May 25, 2014</value><value>March 7, 2020</value><value>March 25, 2020</value><value>March 15, 2020</value><value>March 8, 2020</value><value>March 19, 2020</value><value>March 2, 2020</value><value>March 13, 2020</value><value>March 1, 2020</value><value>March 4, 2020</value><value>March 15, 2020</value><value>March 25, 2020</value><value>March 4, 2020</value><value>March 9, 2020</value><value>March 4, 2020</value><value>March 5, 2020</value><value>March 9, 2020</value></reviewed_date></item>

The flavor is nothing like the box. I find the noodles to be harder and sometimes gummier in texture. They're also not very nutritional. Buy they are cheap. Great for hurricane supplies but otherwise we won't repurchase.</value><value>Its really good but I just don't trust the powder. Things that you can buy at the grocery store that's cheese shouldn't be powdered. However, it does taste like cheese and it is always a nice meal to give to your kids if you don't have much time to cook.</value><value>This product is good for when you dont really feel like making anything or you are trying to teach your kids to start making their own food. Although I wouldnt recommend that it is the healthiest lunch. It is very yummy. Overall I would say that this product is a 8/5 out of 10</value><value>Definitely super easy to use for lunches and they taste pretty good too. I bring them on the go, but i would like a little more product in the container. I only use it when i dont have many options for lunches, but it definitely does the job when Im hungry</value><value>I use to love these as a kid. As an adult this doesnt taste the same anymore. The cheese isnt so cheesy and the flavour is gone. Its almost water downed KD and who would like that? If they brought back the old flavour and taste I would definitely eat this again but until then no thanks you</value><value>Who doesn't love Kraft Mac&amp; Cheese? I buy this one the because if my daughter had her way she would eat it for every meal! She doesn't but I do allow her to have it for lunch a couple times a month. I don't allow her to have to much of microwaveable food plus this  is great to keep on hand and offer her a choice.</value><value>I do really enjoy the convenience of this product in both packaging and preparation time. I think it is a very good option however it definitely does not compare to the taste of the boxed mac &amp; cheese but with that sad this comes with a certain convenience</value><value>Let me start by saying that my daughter will only eat Kraft Mac and cheese out of the microwaveable bowls! I try to scoop it out onto her dinner plate, and she refuses to eat it! It is very tasty and is a staple on our pantry shelf! Very affordable and higher quality taste than store brand.</value><value>The best after school or work snack for people of all ages. The flavor is so freaking good in this mac &amp; cheese cup. The water does like to overflow a little bit when put in the microwave but its and easy clean up. I will always buy these when i go to the store.</value><value>If we make convenient Macaroni &amp; Cheese, it HAS to be Kraft.  My kids know instantly if it doesn't have the craft taste and texture.  Hardly anything else works for them. I've tried making homemade macaroni and cheese from all kinds of recipe books - nothing satisfies them - or is an easier "Dad's not home" dinner - than Kraft Macaroni and Cheese.</value><value>Dont ask me why, but this stuff is sooo much better than the box you make yourself. Its ridiculous. I lived on it after having my wisdom teeth out. Enjoyed it so much I considered having more teeth pulled just as an excuse to have my wife keep buying it. Great stuff</value><value>Great go to for easy lunches! Was actually shocked when I just added water instead of milk that is was creamy is so good. Dont like to eat Mac and cheese all the time cause Im not one for noodles but I would be so down to try a veggie noodle formula.</value><value>As much as I love the original flavor mac n cheese, i do not like the easy mac packets. maybe it's because they're cooked in the microwave but they are in my opinion watered down too much and don't have the creamy richness of the original box dinner.</value><value>I've been eating Kraft dinner since I was so little and I swear I'll never get sick of it! I use to always buy the easy mac packets but as soon as Kraft came out with these convient little cups for my lunches and on the go I was so excited! I love these!</value><value>My kids love these and they love that they can make it themselves in the microwave! These are a must have! Quick and easy! I always have cooked chicken in the fridge so they can warm up chicken and make Mac &amp; cheese for a quick lunch when were in a hurry!</value><value>As a college student this is a necessity. Great to buy in bulk and have for whenever I have a cheesy craving. Even though it's a microwavable product it still is packed with flavor and creamy goodness just like what you'd get if making this on the stove. My favorite meal to have when I am in a rush and it's always super filling</value><value>These come in handy if your in a hurry and hungry. Of course you have to like Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese :)
I like that you can make this in the microwave and not need to use a bowl.</value><value>Kraft has the best Mac and cheese ever nothing beats it. The single cup ones are easy for lunch or a single serving and quicker than making the box ones</value><value>Ive always loved these! So convenient and Im easy to make! Im quite impressed with the creamy ness and flavour of it! Takes me back to my childhood would recommend this</value><value>I used to love these but they dont give you enough cheese powder to put in them anymore. I always have to use 2 packets to give it enough flavor and it taste better if you add a little milk.</value></reviewer_comment><reviewed_date><value>March 5, 2020</value><value>February 29, 2020</value><value>March 14, 2020</value><value>March 3, 2020</value><value>February 29, 2020</value><value>March 24, 2020</value><value>March 26, 2020</value><value>March 9, 2020</value><value>March 2, 2020</value><value>March 9, 2020</value><value>March 10, 2020</value><value>March 10, 2020</value><value>March 10, 2020</value><value>March 16, 2020</value><value>March 15, 2020</value><value>March 13, 2020</value><value>April 7, 2014</value><value>April 3, 2020</value><value>April 1, 2020</value><value>April 2, 2020</value></reviewed_date></item>

I love the classic Mac taste that takes you back to childhood and I eat these quite often.</value><value>I live for these simple microwave cups because of how easy they are. I like these better than the box sometimes just because i find them to be more cheesy! Good flavor and easy to make!</value><value>I always have These in stock at my house. These are so convenient and they taste so good only take three minutes to cook its super fast. It went beyon my expectations Im very satisfied id recommend these to anybody</value><value>These cups are great when making Mac and cheese for one. They are super easy to prepare and only take a couple of minutes in the microwave. They are pretty cheap and make a great easy quick meal.</value><value>This takes me back to my college days. I used to make these all the time in college. This would be a snack while watching a movie. I personally didnt like the powder cheese as much as the other cheese though.</value><value>For what it is these aren't bad. They're probably made for children for starters, otherwise I'd complain about the poor cost effectiveness of having to eat two every time.</value><value>These were my go-to my freshman year of college. I like them because you can make them instantly and it only requires you to add water. I consider these my struggle meals but they always satisfied me.</value><value>These are so great for little kids. I love the amount in each little cup as its great for little kids. They are somewhat affordable, as I wish they were a little cheaper but I dont mind paying the price for these!</value><value>Its a very easy on the go product. Its very delicious . But when you cook it on the microwave it tends to fill out of the cup because its like boiling but its still very affordable and easy. I would definitely recommend this product</value><value>this is always a good way to send with your kid for lunches for school! its so easy to make in the microwave. it taste the same as if you make it on the stove. im pleased with this easy mac</value><value>Im not a fan of the texture of the Easy Mac. It tastes okay but its a bit soggy for me. And I find its expensive compared to other Kraft Dinner products.</value><value>I really like the microwaveable version of this easy mac &amp; cheese just because it is so quick and when you need that quick fix it is really easy to make! It is also really cheap, and can make for a great snack or meal if you choose.</value><value>Super easy and fast in a pinch! Whether its lunch at work or dinner for the kids when they wont eat the gourmet beef stroganoff Julia Childs prepares for them! But always have this in the cupboard for quick easy delicious fix</value><value>Great on the go snack for all ages!!!! Easy to make and quick to make in seconds and taste the best. Sometimes I even prefer this Mac and cheese then more  expensive supposedly better tasting brands.</value><value>I love kraft Mac and cheese and this makes my favorite food a lot easier to have because all you have to do is add water then put it in the microwave!</value><value>I usually buy Mac and cheese for my kids and I we love it mostly because they come in good sized little bowls to have a decent quantity. It has such a good flavor and I love taking these little bowls to work too !</value><value>I dont personally like it, because the flavor is missing. Many people like it but i dont really like it, i would recommend to add spices or stuffs in it if you are really intrested to try it</value><value>This is a really good macaroni and cheese especially if you need a quick lunch or dinner. It is also really easy to cook which is really efficient for people that dont know how to cook. I would totally recommend to everyone.</value><value>This stuff is a classic children's mac n cheese dinner, but as an adult, I really never want to eat this stuff. It's cheap and convenient and good for college dorms.</value><value>Kraft mac and cheese is not really my cup of tea! i love mac and cheese but this brand is kind of bad to me but with certain seasoning i will eat this!</value></reviewer_comment><reviewed_date><value>April 4, 2020</value><value>March 31, 2020</value><value>April 7, 2020</value><value>March 29, 2020</value><value>March 31, 2020</value><value>April 2, 2020</value><value>April 9, 2020</value><value>March 30, 2020</value><value>April 8, 2020</value><value>April 12, 2020</value><value>April 2, 2020</value><value>April 4, 2020</value><value>March 30, 2020</value><value>March 30, 2020</value><value>April 4, 2020</value><value>April 4, 2020</value><value>April 3, 2020</value><value>April 7, 2020</value><value>April 13, 2020</value><value>April 6, 2020</value></reviewed_date></item>

This is an easy way to make it as fast as possible. Its really cheesy. I really recommend it. it is really easy to prepare. This is a good meal. I really recommend it to everyone.</value><value>I know a lot of people love these. But something about packaged cheese or powdered cheese doesnt set well with me. I tried to eat one and it just wasnt working for me.</value><value>These kraft easy Mac taste pretty good, they are super easy to make, just pop them in the microwave. They come with more powder to ratio than the big boxes do, so they taste very cheesy. My bf gets them sometimes for a midnight snack. Lol</value><value>These are my go to lunch item when I want something fast and easy to make. They are soo yummy and taste cheesy which is my favorite. I recommend this to anyone who loves Mac and cheese. The best part is u get 4 in a pack and the price is amazing.</value><value>I bought these for my son's school lunch. Luckily he has a teacher with a microwave and can warm it up! He loves them and asked, why didn't we buy these sooner, they're delicious.</value><value>I love this mac and cheese because its so easy and simple but SO good and cheesy! Great for on the go! [product:kraft-easy-mac-original-flavor-macaroni-&amp;-cheese-dinner]</value><value>These are great little snacks for when youre hungry and dont want to have to make a lot of food. These are also very reasonably price. This isnt the healthiest of meals but it definitely will fill you up!</value><value>I love making these for my toddler. Hes a picky eater but I can easily heat one of these up and serve it to him and he eats the whole thing! I just rinse it with cold water and then put the cheese powder in so its not boiling hot. Hes impatient though.</value><value>These are great, especially if you hate the food at school or if you just want to take food anywhere where theres a microwave available its great. Tastes like made at home mac &amp; cheese. Would always buy if im staying out late and want to eat something till i get back</value><value>Easy cheese is the BEST! it is so handy also. Love me some easy cheese. My kids love it and it is just the right amount. Take the top off, take the cheese packet out, fill with water to the fill line, microwave for 4 minutes and add cheese and your done!</value><value>Ok literally these little individual macaroni cups are fantastic. Theyre decently portioned so when youre craving mac n cheese you dont go overboard. Its also a nice portion to combine with something else to make more of a complete meal, such as broccoli and a little protein. Otherwise, its a great, SUPER EASY to prepare, little meal on its own!</value><value>My children are the Mack and cheese eaters in this house. We like these individual portions because they can fix them themselves very easy to read and children are able to understand them too they do enjoy the flavor the most yes I would recommend this to my friends and I would definitely be buying it again</value><value>A classic college staple. I always make sure to have a few on hand for an easy dinner or snack. They are super easy to make and last a long time. Very affordable. For what these are, they are perfect, especially if you have some extra cheese on hand to add in.</value><value>I love this brand of mac and cheese! The single serve containers are good for a side dish for my kids. They are easy to make and offered at an affordable price. They only take 3.5 minutes to prepare which is great in a pinch. I will definitely buy this product again.</value><value>These are the best Mac and cheese dinners for college students. All you need is some water and a microwave and you are set to cook! These are so addicting and I have bought them multiple times because they are so easy to cook and satisfying while I study.</value><value>I love Mac and cheese come on who doesn't only thing is it feels like it's to much to cook a box bc it takes some time. That's why I love these individual bowls. There quick to make also with me it doesn't make me want to eat the left overs of them ( if any ) it's the perfect portion for me. 1 thing I wish they could fix is to make them a tad cheaper. Oh and it would be great if they experimented with NEW FLAVORS.</value><value>I have been buying these fo a while now. My girls used to only eat these. They preferred them over the box until they got a little bit older not it has switched. They like to have these when they are so hungry and 3 mins is faster than waiting for water to build for the box. Plus the cup is the perfect size for my youngest.</value><value>These things are a life saver and they are sooo delicious! i use these for my kids dinner about 4 out of 7 days of the week! I don't like that they ALWAYS overflow for me in the microwave...but oh well! I just started putting a plate underneath! I will def keep buying</value><value>Kraft Easy Mac Original Flavor Macaroni &amp; Cheese Dinner I buy a case of these every 2 weeks from a Club. My daughter's eat these mac and cheese single servings daily they love the flavor and convenience. I love the price too! They're a great snack or even as a lunch. I'd definitely recommend these because my children love them and I also say these quite often they're loaded with that cheesy flavor and you get a good amount in each serving.</value><value>My kids love the Kraft easy mac bowls. They eat them as after school snacks, lunches, and any other time they want something quick and easy. They are simple enough that the kids can make themselves, and the cleanup is a snap.

We keep these on hand for a quick addition to a meal or for a snack. My son is super picky and sometimes this is all he wants to eat. We still make him try whatever we are having, but Mac and cheese is always a winner.</value><value>I wish the containers were bigger but it's such an easy to-go item and you can heat it up anywhere where you have access to a microwave. It's really good mac n cheese but it doesn't really fill you up, great as a snack though. I usually take them to school with me.</value><value>I love this mac n cheese! It tastes great and is convenient to fix and eat. Add some salsa or some hot sauce for an extra flavor....so delicious! The cheese is in a pouch and easy to squeeze and it is creamy and delicious! This is my favorite Kraft mac n cheese. I order them through subscribe and save...lots of them..they are so good</value><value>Love kraft mac &amp; cheese been eating it since I was little and still eat it today I love the little cheese dinner ones a little bucket ones at the very convenient very little and easy to make simple very very simple and I think its a good food for kids theyre very picky or just you dont know what to feed your child and you know that they like mac &amp; cheese so I think its a very good portion size for them to</value><value>I find the portions to be a bit small, sometimes I need to make two for myself which is just an inconvenience seeing as they are supposed to be something quick to make. it isn't quick when I'm needing to make 2. maybe add more to the product or make a different one with larger proportions</value><value>As a student it saves my life time and time again to come home from a hard day of learning to go home and sit down to enjoy and easily made cup of Mac. It takes so little of my time to make myself a serving which leaves me more time to spend on studying rather than cooking for 40 mins</value><value>Kraft Easy Mac Original Flavor Macaroni &amp; Cheese Dinner pasta mix paired with Velvetta Cheese from Kraft is a real comfort food for most of us. Not only does it taste great but is economical to purchase and prepare . There is also nutrition as Velvetta is manufactured from dairy products which combined with pasta elbows makes with the sauce package a truly great meal.Kraft Easy Mac Original Flavor Macaroni &amp; Cheese Dinner pasta mix paired with Velvetta Cheese from Kraft is a real comfort food for most of us. Not only does it taste great but is economical to purchase and prepare . There is also nutrition as Velvetta is manufactured from dairy products which combined with pasta elbows makes with the sauce package a truly great meal.</value><value>There pretty easy to use makes for quick easy meal its definitely pricey for the amount of product when you can the whole box for the same price but thy are good for when your on the go and you have a picky eater there great I do wish thy would come it a organic or higher quality no additives or artificial flavor would be helpful</value><value>I grew up eating this brand of Mac and cheese and still to this date I eat it. I try and keep this stocked in my home because me and my significant other live Mac and cheese. Its convenient for sure especially when we both work so much and simply dont have time sometimes to make dinner. Its simply to make and oh so tasty.</value><value>This is such a convenient way to eat Mac n cheese. It's  also easy and fun for children to make for themselves. Each serving has just the right amount. I personally use the coffee machine to warm my water up instead of microwaving the whole thing. It's ready to eat within minutes. No dishes to clean and everyone's happy! They're affordable and available everywhere. I'd recommend this product to all my family and friends.</value><value>I used to love eating these when I was in need of food in a pinch at work, always easy to make and yummy. But it seems that they've changed the way they've made it? Not as good as they used to be, and the noodles seem to have some weird gooey texture and doesn't mix well with the cheese and leaves it clumpy and gross</value><value>These are the most handiest little cuos ever.  With 3 kids and 2 play sports all yr round they come in handy for a after school snack till after practice then dinner. They can eat it in the car and it's the right 1 cup portion . I buy these all the time. Depending on where you shop you can get them really cheap.</value><value>These are a big hit in the afternoon when the kids get out of school. They will sit and make a meal out of these. I only find the second to one other brand. Thats why I gave it four instead of five. They are creamy and rich flavored. And the kids find them easy to make.</value><value>This isn't as good as the box but it's a decent substitute. I give these to my son when he doesnt want the food we are making for dinner or take them for lunch when I haven't meal prepped. It's super simple to make and is a good substitute for the traditional boxed mac n cheese.</value><value>My kids love these little mac and cheese bowls, it really easy to make, they only take 3 minutes in the microwave, I literally buy them all the time, and my kids always eat them all really fast we go through them a lot, so I'm always buying them a lot ! They taste great to especially compared to the generic ones if you ever tried the generic ones kraft are way better, the generic ones the noddled get mushy</value><value>I like these. They are easy to use and the perfect size for little ones but are just a snack size for my older kids. Sometimes I add the powder too soon and mess it all up. The noodles have a thickening kind of powder In it thats kind of weird but I get it so it not just chunky or goopy or dry. My kids love it.</value><value>These are exactly what i remember from when i was a little kid and i begged my mom to buy them at the store and make it for me as soon as we got home. I get that its definitely not homemade and with tons of artificial flavoring. But its nostalgic. Although its a tad small for me now. Its a perfect easy snack on the go.</value><value>Are used to eat so many kraft macaroni and cheese singles when I was in high school and college! Its fast , easy and tastes great! It definitely met my expectations and I would buy the bigger version of this macaroni and cheese because it is cheaper!</value><value>Just add some water, microwave for 3.5 mins and mix in the pack of cheese. You have the same mac n cheese from the box in less than 5 minutes, and in individual portions. I use it to feed my toddler since it saves me time, and a whole box would go to waste.</value><value>Kraft Easy Mac is one of the best meal inventions of all time.  It is super easy to make and is tasty.  My kids love that they can make Easy Mac themselves for a snack.  This is something we purchase repeatedly.  I would definitely recommend this product.</value></reviewer_comment><reviewed_date><value>January 12, 2020</value><value>January 12, 2020</value><value>February 26, 2020</value><value>January 23, 2020</value><value>February 3, 2020</value><value>January 11, 2020</value><value>February 7, 2020</value><value>February 8, 2020</value><value>January 29, 2020</value><value>February 27, 2020</value><value>January 21, 2020</value><value>January 25, 2020</value><value>February 11, 2020</value><value>January 17, 2020</value><value>January 29, 2020</value><value>January 18, 2020</value><value>January 19, 2020</value><value>February 14, 2020</value><value>February 10, 2020</value><value>January 4, 2020</value></reviewed_date></item>

These aren't as good as fresh made mac and cheese but these are goid in a pinch or when you really need to satisfy that craving. These are easy to make in my office using the microwave and they come together very quick.</value><value>Classic Kraft mac and cheese! Honestly its a lot of first childrens favorite food and i can definitely see why!! Its also one of the best side dishes for so many great dishes!! I would definitely recommend this to anybody that knows a picky eater out there!</value><value>I LOVE Easy Mac! It is so good! Honestly one of my favorite things to eat! I wish I could eat it more. Its easy to prepare and take to school/work but Its not super filling. I could probably eat two. They arent super cheap either but cheaper than going out.</value><value>Bought these for my  son,as he is a picky eater and if he likes something,I will buy it in bulk! Well,he LOVES these! He eats one pretty much every day! It's easy enough,he can put water in it and microwave it himself. So he feels like he is capable of accomplishing some things himself. Great price,great product,and happy kiddo!</value><value>This is the best quality products that has been made to use by all the people and all the people in your lovely family needing to try out this extremely excellent product product quality in every detail of the package you can also feel house luxury it feel in your hand it make you want to come back for more</value><value>Ok no other Mac n cheese compares to Kraft. Its the only kinda my kids will eat. What I love about these single cups is my 9 year old can make them herself! Perfect for an easy lunch or as a dinner side dish for the kiddos who only eat chicken nuggets and Mac n cheese</value><value>We love these because theyre easy to make and pack. I love that when I have 3 children asking for different things that this can be popped in the microwave and one them has lunch in 3 minutes without having to make and waste a whole box of Mac and cheese</value><value>Easy Mac Kraft dinner used to be the first thing my brother and I would make when we would arrive home from school. It was fast and easy to make, even in elementary school. Anyway I love Kraft dinner so this is a 5/5 for me. Who doesn't like cheese..</value><value>These are such a big hit with my kids.... and me :) we love them! Theyre so easy to make you just add water to the line marked in the cup so no guessing then just pop in the microwave for approximately 3 1/2 minutes, add the cheese, and boom... youre done. Taste delicious because the texture comes out perfect and theres tons of cheese.</value><value>I think this product isn't the best. It is rather cheap but the taste is not as great as Velveeta cheese mac and cheese. I would improve this product but making a better cheese sauce. I used to eat this brand all the time as a kid. A few times as an adult. I would not recommend this much to others considering if they have taste like me they would not enjoy it as much as they should.</value><value>I love the controlled portion size of this pack, because believe me, I can eat a whole box by myself. Also, who doesnt love Kraft Mac n Cheese? Its so yummy and creamy, with just enough saltiness. Its easy to make as well. It makes dinner so fast and easy!</value><value>The best mac and cheese brand. This is a quick and easy side dish or main meal. I like that the mac and cheese doesn't take very long to cook and it only requires three basic ingredients; water, milk, and butter. I forgo the milk and just add extra butter.</value><value>This is super helpful for college students like me who may need a quick and easy snack. Although this kind is not as good as the original, it is very simple and quick when im on the go. This does not taste the same as the original, doesnt have much flavor, gets extremely hot in the microwave, and the noodles come out very mushy. However, it does fill my belly when I need a quick and easy snack!</value><value>This is quick and easy to make when you are on the go. When I was in college I would buy this due to it being cheap but also filling. I know bring it to work with me due to it being easy to prepare. Add milk or water and place it in the microwave. In a few mins you have a wonderful lunch or dinner.</value><value>It doesnt matter how old you are, Kraft Mac and Cheese is a go to! I eat this for lunch very often- almost weekly. The cups are great and super convenient. However, even if you fill to the line or a little under the line, the water can over flow and make a big mess in the microwave!</value><value>Kraft Easy Mac Original Flavor Macaroni &amp; Cheese Dinner cups have been a staple to lunch in our home. As a mom that both works from home and homeschools her three children,  Kraft Easy Mac has been a lunch favorite for both my kids and I. It's easy enough for the kids to prepare and little to no mess. The portion size is great. I highly recommend parents to keep these in the house for those easy and quick to fix lunches.</value><value>Macaroni and cheese is one of my 6 year olds favorite meals at our house! But sometimes he wants it when the rest of us dont! Thats why I love these cups! They are quick and super easy to prepare! It ends up being the perfect portion with him! We like to pair it with some hotdogs or even broccoli! We always make sure to have these on hand!</value><value>Even though Kraft is a name brand its product leaves bad taste in your mouth, quite literally. The powdered cheese is downright disgusting. If you add the suggested amount of water to the product it's too soupy once it comes out of the microwave. Skip this and buy Velveeta.</value><value>I love these it's small so it's good for traveling or packing a lunch. I eat this quiet often when low on money, I would improve by adding bigger packaging and more of a selection. I love the cheese flavor, it's really smooth and creamy. I recommend this to everyone</value><value>These are great! I love to take these to work for my lunches. They aren't the healthiest, but they are a treat once and a while. I love how you can just pop them in a microwave. It takes the exact same as the box kraft dinner. I would recommend these</value></reviewer_comment><reviewed_date><value>January 2, 2020</value><value>February 10, 2020</value><value>February 13, 2020</value><value>January 2, 2020</value><value>February 5, 2020</value><value>February 13, 2020</value><value>February 6, 2020</value><value>January 18, 2020</value><value>January 18, 2020</value><value>February 10, 2020</value><value>January 21, 2020</value><value>February 14, 2020</value><value>January 30, 2020</value><value>February 4, 2020</value><value>January 31, 2020</value><value>February 14, 2020</value><value>February 25, 2020</value><value>February 1, 2020</value><value>January 27, 2020</value><value>January 19, 2020</value></reviewed_date></item>

It is also easy to carry to work and keep in your car! Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese is a classic product and I will keep buying it! I eat it about once a month and recommend it to others!</value><value>Love the easy side items! My family and everyone I know has grew up eating Kraft Macaroni &amp; Cheese. It is so easy to cook these Easy Macs. Add water &amp; pop in the microwave for a few mins. I especially like the convenience of these little guys when I am in a rush to get dinner or lunch served. I will always have Kraft Easy Mac Original Flavor Macaroni &amp; Cheese dinner in my cupboards.</value><value>Perfect when youre in a rush and need something quick! I try not to eat it too often as its not a very healthy option but it tastes great! I grew up on Kraft Mac and Cheese and even after trying other brands, I always come back to Kraft! The flavor and consistency are my favorite!</value><value>I love these! My favorite brand of Mac and cheese because I love yellow cheese so much! Its also childhood! I like the easy Mac cups because you dont have to wait 5 min for hot water to boil then pour the macaroni and then wait for it tocook then cheese it which takes forever. Instead you pop this guy in the microwave for about 2 minutes and sprinkle the cheese and your done! I kick and easy!</value><value>My child loves macaroni and cheese and this makes the perfect afternoon snack when shes starving. A quick pop in the microwave and shes ready to go, not to mention its also a perfect lunch treat for an exhausted momma who needs something quick and easy to make</value><value>Kraft brand is likley the most preferred brand I buy. Since 1975 I have ate Kraft macaroni and cheese sometimes weekly sometimes 3 days a week. These newer microwave singles are pretty good. They aren't the same as the kind you make at home on the stove. But they did good getting it as similiar as possible</value><value>Mac n cheese is one of my favorite things to eat, and Im a very small adult and I dont always eat very much, these are perfect for me to take with me to work for my lunch! I will say they usually dont fill me up, so if youre someone that eats a decent amount of food, you would want the actual boxes of Mac n cheese as these are pretty small, they work really great for kids too!</value><value>My kids and myself love these. When ever I crave mac and cheese I'll eat one or two of these. they have good taste and if made right are cheesy. I think they are a little high in price of just a pack of four the only reason I buy is because of my kids and the kids I babysit</value><value>It's an alright cup of mac and cheese. Great for dorm life because it's quick and convenient. Pretty affordable. Not as good as what's in the box. There typically isnt enough cheese sauce to coat everything, and it tends to clump so its uneven in flavor.</value><value>I have POTS so this is something I can make quick as a college student and sprinkle a ton of salt on to help me hold my fluids! Not to mention it's flavor is pretty great too, especially if you add peas, ham, or extra cheese. Honestly one of my "guilty pleasure" dinners to make!</value><value>This is so easy to just pop in the microwave and let it cook then you add your cheese flavoring, and yum in the tum it's done. It is priced very reasonably and packaged well. Tastes great and never disappoints my taste buds. Very satisfied with this product.</value><value>I think this is a very convenient way to make Mac n cheese. If you dont have enough time just add milk or water, pop it in the microwave for 3 minutes and youre good to go. It taste delicious and has a nice consistency. Only issue is that it is snack sized, for me at least. I typically eat a whole kraft box myself.</value><value>Maybe I'm simple but I still love original Kraft Mac and Cheese. I've been eating this stuff since I was a kid and it's definitely one of my comfort foods. I don't eat it frequently, but these cups are super convenient for a quick lunch at work. I will continue to buy on occasion.</value><value>Kraft Mac and cheese is the best other than homemade in the oven mac and cheese. And this little guy us awesome.  Quick and easy. Makes for a quick little snack and great fir the kids fir an after school snack. Very satisfied with it and definitely recommend it if you haven't tried it already.</value><value>Not very healthy but so great in a pinch for days at work. Its easy to prepare, fast to cook, has the flavor of macaroni you make on the stove and obviously easy to carry with you for work or wherever. Its not necessarily healthy by any means but if youre not too concerned its a good choice.</value><value>I do not eat Kraft macaroni from the box anymore, so this is soo perfect and convenient! It tastes just like the regular boxed one, but gets done much quicker! It comes in a disposable microwaveable bowl, with the cheese sauce packet apart. All you do is just add water, microwave for three minutes, stir in the cheese sauce powder, and voil!</value><value>I personally love these. I think they taste just like the box that you boil and they only take about 3.5 minutes to cook in the microwave. Theyre good for packed lunch because all you need is water and access to a microwave. My only problem with these is that they could stand to be a little larger portion.</value><value>This Microwavable Mac and cheese is perfect for on the go or Snack Time or both!  We enjoy this when we aren't in the mood to make a whole box, Great for late night snack when the kids are asleep.</value><value>Kraft is our go to Mac and cheese. It seems better than all the other brands, it's very cheesy and it has a good flavor to it. It's probably not healthy for you but it's pretty good, and easy to make</value><value>This is one  Mac&amp;cheese I prefers to have when I am too lazy to go to my dining hall. Its doesnt take long to make. Good thing to take with you when you have long trip or for college dorm</value></reviewer_comment><reviewed_date><value>February 17, 2020</value><value>January 18, 2020</value><value>February 24, 2020</value><value>January 17, 2020</value><value>January 10, 2020</value><value>February 8, 2020</value><value>February 8, 2020</value><value>January 15, 2020</value><value>February 24, 2020</value><value>February 4, 2020</value><value>February 26, 2020</value><value>February 5, 2020</value><value>January 19, 2020</value><value>February 20, 2020</value><value>January 3, 2020</value><value>February 18, 2020</value><value>February 11, 2020</value><value>March 4, 2020</value><value>March 5, 2020</value><value>March 1, 2020</value></reviewed_date></item>

Unfortunately this does not taste quite as good as the original box type and has a habit of coming out a bit runny.</value><value>These are great for making for my toddlers. Very easy.

[product:kraft-easy-mac-original-flavor-macaroni-&amp;-cheese-dinner]</value><value>My baby really really really loves this macaroni I especially like it myself but I guess because it comes in an individual little bowl  thats why he eats it even better</value><value>Wow this product is so good it definitely didnt meet my expectations. In my opinion its worth just buying the full size box instead of doing these small ones. Theyre just not as good tasting but you get what youre paying for.</value><value>My kids love Kraft mac n cheese. They also love being able to make it themselves when they want to. It's so easy to make and quick also. It does not cost a lot.</value><value>I feel like everyone likes KD. Its always easy to make and quick when you are in a pinch. Maybe not the best for you, as you can make your own versions but these come in handy when time is not on your side.</value><value>Its a easy on the go lunch. When im running late i usually grab a bowl and im on my way out because theyre so convenient. They taste like normal mac and cheese and its already portioned out for you</value><value>These macaroni cups, are perfect  so cheesy and easy to make! I buy these for my daughter since my boyfriend doesnt like Mac i just make one of these for my daughter and i as a side dish and its very delicious!</value><value>This is a great grab and go lunch that tastes like good original kraft dinner. It isnt the healthiest but definitely tastes good! It is easy to prepare in no time. I would recomment!</value><value>Kraft mac n cheese is 100% my go to over velveeta. I like velveeta but always preferred this over it. The character noodles are a huge plus for my 5 year old, she loves them!! Theyre SUPER affordable and we love them!</value><value>Its good and taste good , easy to prepare specially when you are too hungry and you need something fast , they can improve it though by making it a bigger size of cup I do recommend it even that is not that healthy</value><value>Convenient and cheap while staying in a hotel but not as tasty as the regular add-milk-and-butter box. I'd buy them again, but they were not my favorite just-add-water microwave cup food.</value><value>I love Macaroni and cheese from this brand. This cups are easy to prepare and the final product never disappoints, is creamy and very tasty everybody at home loves this</value><value>These are a staple in my dorm room! Easy to make and taste delicious! Plus its a great serving size and I dont have to worry about left overs going to waste!</value><value>This is a classic go to snack/meal. Even better when you pair it up with a meat and cheese grilled cheese. It is a little watery and milky tasting but still good.</value><value>I really like how fast and easy these are too make when you need a quick meal fast. Kraft dinner is kind of a guilty pleasure of mine and the brand name is definitely worth the extra bit of money!</value><value>Love this personal bowls or mac and cheese. They save me so much time when making my daughter a quick meal or as lunch for day care. She absolutely love them. They are also the cheesiest mac &amp; cheese.</value><value>Does it get any better than this? No. It doesnt. The flavor, the convenience, the price?? Love this stuff! So easy to take to work or eat between classes. I love this stuff and will continue to buy it!</value><value>Great snack for kiddos easy to make just add water if your kid is 8 and older he or she can possibly make it themselves if they aren't too clumsy  make sure to let it sit for a minute to cool and get soft</value><value>Easy for a snack or quick lunch. They do taste a bit artificial, but other than that, theyre pretty great. They have the right amount of cheese added in them.</value><value>A college staple. I always eat these in my dorm because they are so easy and so good! I like the flavor of the way better than velveta, tastes more like real cheese.</value></reviewer_comment><reviewed_date><value>March 26, 2020</value><value>March 19, 2020</value><value>March 10, 2020</value><value>March 21, 2020</value><value>March 14, 2020</value><value>March 12, 2020</value><value>March 13, 2020</value><value>March 27, 2020</value><value>March 21, 2020</value><value>February 29, 2020</value><value>March 15, 2020</value><value>March 4, 2020</value><value>March 1, 2020</value><value>March 28, 2020</value><value>March 8, 2020</value><value>March 7, 2020</value><value>March 4, 2020</value><value>March 24, 2020</value><value>March 15, 2020</value><value>March 1, 2020</value></reviewed_date></item>

Its great for packing on the go and warming in a microwave. Very light weight and convenient. Very satisfied with the size</value><value>I love these things! Theyre perfect little snacks for on the go or at home! I get the 4 pack so they last me a while, Ill eat these at work or just when Im at home and need lunch! They are affordable and I would recommend to others!</value><value>Maybe its the way I made it but it was very watery and not that cheesy. It did not meet my expectations, I was highly disappointed. It would have been better if they gave more cheese powder. I havent bought another one since...</value><value>I LOVE these mac and cheese packs! These are so convenient, whether you're scarfing down food during a work break, or you don't feel like dirtying dishes and cooking on the stove. I had mac and cheese constantly as a kid...if only my babysitters could've had access to these decades ago! I like to bring these packs to work and they're a major hit with my coworkers. I personally like to slightly alter the directions. Rather than filling the container to the line before putting it in the microwave, I like to just barely cover all of the noodles with water (usually filling to a centimeter or two below the line), then microwave, then pour cold water up to the line. This speeds up the cooling down process, allowing me to consume the mac and cheese within five minutes.</value><value>This is a really good mac &amp; cheese I always go to craft mac &amp; cheese because it always has the best flavor this one is really easy to make. I eat them at least 2 to 3 times a week I always recommend to them to other people because they taste amazing and kids love them.</value><value>I'm sorry but Kraft Dinner is disgusting. I love Mac n Cheese and I just can't stomach this. For me, it's that awful powder that turns into cheese that just throws me off. I know it's cheap and so many people enjoy it, but UGH- I just can't. Makes me sad because I want to eat an abundance of Mac n Cheese.</value><value>I love this product because I can be lazy and or rushed sometimes and this is quick and easy if I want a small snack I'll get the small bowl if I'm a little hungry or I can purchase the larger Bowl has a delicious flavor it doesn't taste strange even though it's cooked in the microwave the price is great and if you have kids I would suggest stocking up</value><value>Sounds and looks gross but... never judge a book by its cover. This stuff is seriously good! And soooo easy! Perfect for camping, snacking on the go, students, etc! It turns out being very creamy after its done in the microwave. It doesnt taste just like normal boxed kraft dinner, so it changes it up and actually tastes super good!</value><value>Love these products. Great flavor and a family favorite. Everything taste amazing. Would not change anything about the product. I would recommend to others as it appeals so much to the children. Also have some on hand. Will continue to buy the product.</value><value>This is great if you don't want to make a full meal and this is quick and easy to do. I wouldn't say it's very healthy but they have ones where it's less sodium you can find. This brand is a brand I trust and have been using for some time and their pretty affordable in price.</value><value>This was such a convenience when our daughter went off to college. I could offer her a bit of home while she was out and on the go to classes or stuck in the dorms on a rainy day. We bought these in a large box size, so she had a stocked supply. Thanks for making it possible for us to provide easily accessible comfort food. And she loved it!</value><value>Kraft Easy Mac Original Flavor Macaroni &amp; Cheese Dinner pasta mix paired with Velvetta Cheese from Kraft is a real comfort food for most of us. Not only does it taste great but is economical to purchase and prepare . There is also nutrition as Velvetta is manufactured from dairy products which combined with pasta elbows makes with the sauce package a truly great meal.</value><value>I eat these all the time. When I was a freshman in college this was a quick and easy late night study snack. So easy to make and tastes the same as when you make it on the stove. These are definitely my favorite in terms of cheap and easy study food.</value><value>The Kraft Easy Mac was very convenient and easy when I was in collage. Everyone knows how broke collage kids usually are and I mainly survived off of this stuff. It was pretty good for being something quick and easy. I'd definitely recommend for all the other struggling college kids.</value><value>This is still as good as the first day I tried it. Its creamy and cheesy flavor is just so good! What can I say It's all kids favorite. Now I'm hungry again. To bad I'm in a diet. Does it has real vitamins in the package? I like how it comes in a little cup.</value><value>I'm a college student so I can not explain how much I use these. They are so easy to make and taste so good. It definitely meet my expectations and is so easy to make in my dorm. They are super affordable even for a college student. I would recommend for anyone kids, teens, or adult.</value><value>This is a great go to for an after school snack or a quick dinner or lunch. The quick convenient product is a go to for our household when we need something and dinner isn't planned. The taste is good and it's super easy to make. The packaging is nice and easy to use</value><value>Anything with Kraft already hits close to home for me, as eating their dinner packs were a big part of my childhood. I almost view them as a type of comfort food. So personally, I find their Mac &amp; Cheese to be very soft, creamy, and flavourful. The package is also easy to prepare and works well if you're in a time crunch.</value><value>I love mac &amp; cheese it is quick and easy. It has a good flavor. This is great to give your baby one starting them on table food. Definitely met my expectations. I love that you can make this so quick for your loved ones on the nights that you dont have much energy to cook dinner.</value><value>Can't go wrong with some good ol' KD. Its part of my childhood growing up with my sisters making mac n cheese for lunch. Its cheap delicious and quick. I feel like start to finish its about 15minutes. 

Its nice that you can just keep it in the pantry. Overall I'd recommend this product</value></reviewer_comment><reviewed_date><value>March 16, 2020</value><value>March 25, 2020</value><value>March 14, 2020</value><value>August 25, 2012</value><value>November 29, 2019</value><value>October 2, 2019</value><value>November 19, 2019</value><value>December 11, 2019</value><value>November 15, 2019</value><value>December 20, 2019</value><value>December 21, 2019</value><value>November 19, 2019</value><value>October 1, 2019</value><value>December 10, 2019</value><value>December 18, 2019</value><value>December 11, 2019</value><value>December 3, 2019</value><value>December 19, 2019</value><value>December 4, 2019</value><value>December 27, 2019</value></reviewed_date></item>

My kids use to love these. Its easy to prepare and he loved these. He super picky. But i just dont like the powder cheese product. The color Itself makes you feel like you know its got so many probably unhealthy additives</value><value>We love these! My daughter is a Mac and Cheese fiend but refuses left overs. These cups are perfect portion sizes and added bonus, she can make it herself now! I should probably be ashamed to admit how often these are in her dinner rotations but she is a picky 9 year old and sometimes it is just easier to give her what she likes than fight and send her to bed hungry.</value><value>I love these cuz they are quick &amp; easy !! I do not cook,so if I can't microwave it....or open an eat it I usually don't eat it !! These typically run for a reasonable price and the lil bit of extra $$ I pay for is worth it to me.Becasue in my opinion KRAFT mac &amp; cheese is SO much better than the off brands !! That's just my personal opinion.....</value><value>These were a life saver in college and late nights! And still are! Im obsessed with eating these as a snack or just something to hold me down. I can also flavor it with salt and pepper or hot sauce to change it up and still tastes perfect! I cant recommend this enough</value><value>These are my go-to! I love them. Theyre very easy to make as you just add water and you put them in the product. I havent had them in awhile but when I do get them, Ill eat them a few times a month, Theyre a nice treat for me since I am lactose intolerant; it really does remind me of my childhood. The only thing I do wish is that they have a slightly bigger size you can purchase. I usually need to eat 2-3 of these to really feel satisfied.</value><value>I meant to select the original box not the microwave cup. The box has its own taste and Its the only one I like. It's cheap and easy to make.  It's not something I would serve giest for dinner but its definitely something I would serve myself.  Its making me want some now.  I recommend this brand and product.</value><value>This is one of the easiest, and most delicious lunches or snacks you can get.  Super fast in the microwave, super easy to make, you really can't go wrong with Easy Mac!  My 2 year old LOVES this, and she is a picky one!  Not very healthy, but when you're a busy parent on a budget....who cares?</value><value>These are super easy to make and then I get them for my family all the time. Its a great after school snack for kids and its super easy to make and its very hard to mess it up in there doesnt really need to be an Adult supervision. Highly recommend I will purchase again.</value><value>Perfection in a microwaveable cup.</value><value>This is a quick college snack for a college student.</value><value>Super snack the kids can fix themselves.</value><value>When every I am craving some Mac and cheese I always go for this. It is so easy to make and is ready in minutes. It also taste amazing</value><value>Like any cheese product Kraft meal is great so if you plan to have a light snack one 2.05 oz. should be enough but for dinner I recommend 2.</value><value>My kids love these. I have bought the Valvedere brand and it is great too, but its really hard to beat kraft mac &amp; cheese!</value><value>The traditional kraft Mac and cheese taste that takes 1/4 the time to make! Quick and easy for when my kids need a meal!</value><value>You could buy this cheaper at a grocery store but it was easy for me to just get it then. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]</value><value>These are good for quick and easy snacks for kids, or when you have picky eaters that wont eat the same foods, that way you dont have to waste a pot</value><value>Kraft is one of my favorites.

It has the same great taste and I only make enough for myself.</value><value>Love love the Mac &amp; Cheese dinner that Kraft has. I always am glad to have it. Very easy to prepare and very fast.

Just enjoy the food while you have it and eat it all gone</value><value>I love Mac and cheese and I absolutely love this brand. I dont eat this very often because i am lactose intolerant but this is very affordable and its just great. I used to eat this I a lot when I was little.</value><value>these are super convenient when your hungry but not starving. kraft has always been delicious. super cheesy!! doesnt take long at all to make. and perfect portion size.</value><value>These are not as good as the stove top version, but microwave food never is. They're convenient for picky kids, and maybe a quick grab lunch for running out the doorwhen you're late for work. But their overall taste is meh.</value><value>Genuinely the only thing that got em through college and saved Thanksgiving for my daughter. Wish they didnt boil over so quickly, but Im sure thats on me.</value><value>The original flavour is the fan favourite in our house. These are great for a fast lunch. They are not the healthiest thing. They are easy on my pocket book when bought in bulk.</value><value>Quick and great for an easy snack if you cant get a full meal. I ate these a lot overseas. Quick tip add tuna to make it tastier.

You pay a little more for prepackaged individuals but in a pinch, it's nice to have in the pantry.</value><value>A great quick and easy snack, side, or meal and all that is needed is water!! When Im in a hurry and cant pack a lunch I grab one of these and still get excited once lunch time rolls around</value><value>So easy and affordable, great for a quick lunch or snack. The flavour is always awesome and its a great amount. I would buy this again since I eat this at least twice a week.</value><value>This is the good stuff. This is what every adult dreams of when they think of their childhood. Its soft and creamy and cheesy and perfect. Love it and will continue to eat it forever.</value><value>Easy to grab, fast to make, and pretty good flavor for microwave meals. Not too bad for $1 each (average). I do wish they were a little bigger. Sometimes one is just not enough, but two is a little too much.</value><value>I love how easy it is to make this when you want a quick snack or for my child. Add some water, 3 minutes in the microwave and its done. It tastes just like I made it from the box.</value></reviewer_comment><reviewed_date><value>February 21, 2020</value><value>January 29, 2020</value><value>February 5, 2020</value><value>January 24, 2020</value><value>February 9, 2020</value><value>January 22, 2020</value><value>January 10, 2020</value><value>January 18, 2020</value><value>January 28, 2020</value><value>December 30, 2019</value><value>January 2, 2020</value><value>February 10, 2020</value><value>January 6, 2020</value><value>February 18, 2020</value><value>February 8, 2020</value><value>February 13, 2020</value><value>January 31, 2020</value><value>February 21, 2020</value><value>January 4, 2020</value><value>February 6, 2020</value></reviewed_date></item>

They taste watery compared to the Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese box noodles. The portion size of this is also small which doesnt make for a meal.</value><value>Im not exactly great with the stove, so I love these kraft cups. They literally take 5 minutes to make. All you need to do is add some water and pop the cup in the blender! Super easy to make and sooo delicious.</value><value>Childhood in a box. Seriously this just hits different. Its good any time of the day and can be an entree or side item. No matter how sophisticated your palette is, this stuff is just plain good.</value><value>Im a big fan of the Kraft Mac and cheese. I like to purchase these for my son it really easy to make and also my son is a big fan of cheese. The taste is really good. Over all Im satisfied.</value><value>I love Mac &amp; cheese so much these are so easy to bring on vacations or for a quick lunch. So easy to make and they are so good! I always have them at the house.</value><value>These are a easy and quick lunch side for my daughter on days we dont have the time to make a full lunch! It also helps that she loves them and the different themes they come in!</value><value>This is my 2 year old little boys favorite dinner, sometimes even breakfast haha. He calls it cheez and he asks for it often, so we have to buy it by the big box lol. We are pretty happy with this product because its quick and easy!</value><value>My daughters love these Mac and cheese cups and I wont buy any brand but Kraft!!  It has always been a trusted brand and has great flavor! Overall very satisfied!</value><value>I love having these around when your in a pinch sometimes work gets busy and I dont have time to leave to grab something this can just chill in my desk and I dont have to worry about it spoiling and when I need something quick bam! Theres lunch</value><value>I eat this for lunch and dinner and theyre so easy to make! Kraft is the only brand I buy from for Mac and cheese and my family goes through these sooo fast! So yummy and flavorful!</value><value>I do not like these. Bought it once and honestly I can never get it again. It had an awful consistency and flavour to it. I really enjoy regular Mac and Cheese by Kraft but this was just gross</value><value>I love these little Mac and cheese bowls. Its perfect for a quick meal or even to make as a dinner side. Super easy and it eliminates making a mess in the kitchen.</value><value>This is OK in a pinch but quite disappointing compared to the original box to Mac and cheese. It makes a huge mess in the microwave every time on the water boils over and consistently can be very gummy.</value><value>You know what they say " it's the cheesiest ' this stuff is the bomb !! Super yummy.!! I add in some extra cheese to mine and maybe top with some fresh tomatoes , OMG it's so good</value><value>Quick, easy and very helpful to have on hand. Great for those pocket eaters. As good for the little ones as it is for adults. Eliminates the need for a stovetop version.</value><value>I absolutely love easy mag because it is delicious, convenient, and pre-packaged for individual consumption. Not everyone needs to make an entire family sized box when they want macaroni and cheese. This is a perfect solution to that problem.</value><value>My two teenagers (16/13) love these Kraft Mac and cheese bowls. They can take them to school for lunch which is great. Its super easy to make. Its fast and convenient. Cant complain about them.</value><value>These are great for when you have to work or just need a single serving. All you do is add water and put it in the microwave. Its easy to make and the flavour is there. Its not as good as out of the box but its still good.</value><value>This is definitely something that you can grab quick to make when you have to make something fast and kids seem to enjoy it. It is pretty processed but the price is cheap and it is a fast thing to make when time is not on your side</value><value>This is about the only thing my 2 and 3 year old will eat! We went a little while where my 3 year old wouldnt touch anything to eat, unless it was Mac and cheese! She still adores this food and has consumed two bowls today!</value></reviewer_comment><reviewed_date><value>January 18, 2020</value><value>January 27, 2020</value><value>January 18, 2020</value><value>February 11, 2020</value><value>January 30, 2020</value><value>February 13, 2020</value><value>February 13, 2020</value><value>January 27, 2020</value><value>January 10, 2020</value><value>January 10, 2020</value><value>January 24, 2020</value><value>February 7, 2020</value><value>January 3, 2020</value><value>February 6, 2020</value><value>February 3, 2020</value><value>January 15, 2020</value><value>February 17, 2020</value><value>January 7, 2020</value><value>January 26, 2020</value><value>February 4, 2020</value></reviewed_date></item>

She will inhale these little cups. I also take them to work with me as well. Easy grab and go when I didnt make dinner the night prior.

It taste really good and its easy if you have kids! Im not sure if its healthy or not though If youre concerned about that I would look into it</value><value>My toddler loves these.. they cook throughly unlike the velveta brand their shells get stuck together and dont get cooked all the way through so they end up hard. But this brand is just perfect.</value><value>Tastes like the stove top kraft Mac and cheese. Its very easy to cook and perfect for single servings! Very affordable and great for people on the go! The preparation is super simple you just need water and a microwave!</value><value>This product is good and easy to make when your hungry. Yes this product meet my expectations. No improvements on this product. This product is affordable.</value><value>These are so good. Extremely easy to make and really convenient. These are not extremely healthy but they do make for an easy meal/snack. Theyre pretty affordable. Even though they are satisfying, theyre not entirely filling.</value><value>My goto easy dinner on a lazy night. Just  pour macaroni onto the microwaveable bowl, add hot water  and microwave for 10minutes. (Easy peasy lemon squeesy! ) it is affordable and convenient.</value><value>My kids and I absolutely love this mac and cheese and especially in the cups. They can make this themselves so very easily. Its totally affordable as well.</value><value>My kids love these. I like that they are a quick and easy snack they can make for themselves. I dont think theyre as good as the regular version though.</value><value>These are the perfect size. Taste the same as the one in the box. Its easy fast and convenient and the right portion for smaller kids. Only takes like 3 min and directions are easy and made simple.</value><value>These are ridiculously amazing and addicting. So nice to have when you need a quick fill up. I love how easy they are to make and bring with you to work for lunches!?</value><value>This is my go to meal to pick up when I aint got time to cook. This is my childhood mac n cheese dream, I love the cheese flavor tho. Its affordable so why not pick one up.</value><value>Its a classic for a reason. Mac and Cheese available in seconds - a beautiful concept. While it isnt the highest quality mac &amp; cheese, it is very enjoyable and crave-worthy.</value><value>Great snack food, lunch, etc. So cheesy &amp; very affordable for after school snack. Not very healthy but absolutely delicious! Maybe they could sneak in some vegetables to help me feel guilt free after eating!</value><value>I grew up on eating this Mac and cheese everyday of my entire childhood. I love the cheesiness and the size of the noodles. This size is perfect for taking to school or work and what is even better is you can microwave this!!</value><value>I grew up eating this product on a daily basis. I highly recommend for people who are on the go or are on a low budget. It was the perfect amount to fill me up. The directions are exactly correct, so make sure to use them.</value><value>I am who I am. I am a 26-year-old with because birds of an 11-year-old. I love chicken fingers and this is the only Mac and cheese that I will eat.lol</value><value>Okay. These are good... but I cant stand the slight slimy film it gets on the container when you microwave it. If there was a way to change that, Id love this product. My niece swears by this as a after school snack</value><value><?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

You have the same mac n cheese from the box in less than 5 minutes, and in individual portions.
I use it to feed my toddler since it saves me time, and a whole box would go to waste.</value><value>Cheesy, cream and great taste!  Only Mac</value><value>I got these for my son. He loves them. Tastes great, easy to make, no mess.</value><value>The food is okay the delivery sucks buy a four pack of mac cheese and I was delivered one cup</value><value>This is so good when you just need something.</value><value>Need I say more; these Easy Mac cups rock. From shelf to table in three minutes.</value><value>So easy and tasty, me and my son both liked them alot. I just ordered a few more.</value><value>Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese 4 pack is a very good lunch pack to have at my desk and it store will</value><value>I send these to my daughter in college. She pops them in the microwave and loves them!</value><value>I thoroughly enjoy all the various flavors of Kraft mac and cheese Deluxe dinners with the sealed pouch of cheese that is added to the noodles after they are cooked.  This item was tried for the convenience of a quick cooking time of only 3.5 minutes.  What a disappointment.  The flavor is horrible.  In fact ... there is actually no flavor to speak of.  A small lump of noodles covered in a binder of some sort.  If you are hungry ... and you probably are at lunch or dinner time ... that hunger will remain after eating one of these meals.  A serving contains 2.05 ounces of mac and cheese.  This serving of mac and cheese amounted to 8 tablespoons of food.  Yes, I took the time to count the amount food in the second container after eating the meager portion of the first container.  This product may satisfy the hunger of a small child but not one a 44 year old man.  I suggest you say 'NO" to this product and purchase the Kraft Deluxe mac and cheese meals.</value><value>I think these little dinners are great for kids but not necessarily for adults. It has a okay taste and if you need something fast, then they're fine.</value><value>I like the taste and so easy for a single person to whip up!  Something that may be helpful to those on a low salt diet,  the salt is in with the dry macaroni and can be shaken off or out of the cup before adding the water, if you so desire. It does taste like the original Kraft macaroni and cheese you buy in the box!</value><value>Kraft mac &amp; cheese is the best mac &amp; cheese ever. Its very easy to make and I instructions are pretty straightforward I believe it takes about three minutes to make this mac &amp; cheese and it has really amazing flavor. Its really affordable and I do recommend you trying it</value><value>so even though this does not have the actual cheese, and it's powder is actually really, really good, I eat this as often as I can, and there's nothing to improve the product, it's overall good, and it's easy to prepare. I would buy it again and I've definitely recommend</value><value>This microwaveable version is quite good but I feel like it is not as good as the ones that you actually have to boil the noodles and add the cheese powder as well as the butter as well or margarine I feel like in general heart is very basic but you can always spice it up with your own ingredients and make it better.</value><value>Super quick and affordable! Easy instructions that are easy to follow. Great snack for when I was in college and needed to have a quick lunch in between classes. Flavour was amazing and always just added a bit of milk and extra cheese to make it more cheesier and creamier!</value><value>Kraft Macaroni and Cheese is the perfect part to a healthy, balanced lifestyle! I have never been too far from my Kraft and it is incredible for any meal. Add some hot dogs, or some extra milk, or double the flavor packets.  Kraft Macaroni and Cheese is simply the greatest and easiest meal for a cheap mother trying to please four picky children.</value><value>These are easy for on the go. They arent super filling, so sometimes I will treat them as a snack more than a meal. They are fast cooking in the microwave, but I must warn you that you will most likely burn your tongue while eating this unless you wait forever.</value><value>Mac and cheese are probably the one food item that will ALWAYS be found in my pantry because without it, my children would riot.  This particular product is probably my go to life saver when my son is insisting on mac and cheese but I just don't have the time to make a full box on the stove.  Its one of the easiest things you can make and comes together in less than 5 minutes.  The flavor isn't quite as good as making the full box with milk and butter (or margarine) but the kids don't care so I don't care.  My only complaint is that it isn't as cost effective as buying the boxes but the quick preparation and convenience can't be beat.</value><value>I love these little easy mac's for on the go. They are super easy and quick to make, with only needing water and a microwave. They dont taste quite as good as regular mac n cheese, but you sacrifice that for the easy cooking that this comes with. Great choice when needing a quick meal.</value></reviewer_comment><reviewed_date><value>February 14, 2013</value><value>April 22, 2020</value><value>April 2, 2020</value><value>April 23, 2020</value><value>April 25, 2020</value><value>August 18, 2011</value><value>August 4, 2013</value><value>November 28, 2012</value><value>November 15, 2013</value><value>April 18, 2020</value><value>January 10, 2014</value><value>January 5, 2017</value><value>March 29, 2020</value><value>March 30, 2020</value><value>April 6, 2020</value><value>April 4, 2020</value><value>April 18, 2020</value><value>March 31, 2020</value><value>March 30, 2020</value><value>March 31, 2020</value></reviewed_date></item>

Super easy even for a preteen.  It's hard to mess up.  I wouldn't call them healthy, but they are better than some other options they could choose.  In 5 min they can have this made and can stop standing in front of the open fridge.</value><value>Ingrediants are good enough. My son likes it!</value><value>So easy to prepare. Tastes good and the kids love it.</value><value>This product is well worth the money. Excellent taste and portioned well. Easy to prepare.</value><value>These are great for kids or anyone needing a portable lunchbox even snack. Do I think it is a healthy option, but  it could be worse. Sometimes the pull tab lid doesnt rip off perfectly well. That is annoying but overall not bad.  Sometimes it does have too much of a fake taste .</value><value>I remember those days when I didn't know how to cook and I got home from school and there was nothing to eat yet. This was my every day meal that I would make myself to wait for my mom to get home and cook dinner. Super unhealthy but super good tase. I would try not to buy them again</value><value>These are awesome! I love having these at home as Im a mom and when your little ones are hungry after school these are the easiest and filling thing they love to eat. Very convenient and delicious! I even love eating these myself when I need a quick fix. Recommend to all my parents out there.</value><value>This is perfect for anyone, especially kids, when youre rushing around. They easily pop in the microwave and they taste delicious! It is also a good portion size. I would recommend this to anyone but especially for anyone who has kids running around.</value><value>fantastic, beautiful, tasty, creamy, yummy, hits the spot. its cheap, it has easy to follow instructions with ingredients you probably already have in your house (milk/butter) I buy these all the time for a yummy lunch or with hot dogs for dinner. love these!</value><value>Okay.  Who does NOT like macaroni and cheese?  This one in particular has good and bad reviews from me.  Same great flavor and very easy to prepare.  There just is NOT enough.  Price is also a tad bit high but worth it if you factor in the time you save.</value><value>The original KD is a hit in my house. Its a great easy alternative for a side dish with dinner or even on its own. We have it for lunch too. Sometimes we even like cutting up hotdogs and putting it in. Sounds gross but trust me!!! Its good. I dont really like the cups. I prefer the original boxed kind.</value><value>These are my go-to! I love them. Theyre very easy to make as you just add water and you put them in the product. I havent had them in awhile but when I do get them, Ill eat them a few times a month, Theyre a nice treat for me since I am lactose intolerant; it really does remind me of my childhood. The only thing I do wish is that they have a slightly bigger size you can purchase. I usually need to eat 2-3 of these to really feel satisfied.</value><value>Super convenient and one of my favorite late night snacks. super cheesy and same old delicious kraft that we all know and love. its not very expensive either and its a great deal for the serving size.. YES I am over satisfied with this product  Kraft Easy Mac Original</value><value>Theres something about being able to cook your food in the microwave that isnt great but this right here is delightful. Its so good and you can even eat it as a quick snack. I think its practical and why not purchase a few microwaveable bowls of Mac!</value><value>I ate these all the time when I was younger. I think craft is a basic Mac classic. It is amazing, but it is not disgusting. I think now that im older, I do prefer other mac and cheeses such as white cheddar. I think this Mac and Cheese dinner is a classic and something everyone enjoys once in awhile.</value><value>This meal is a classic. Lunch, dinner, heck maybe even breakfast. When I reflect on my childhood, I think about Kraft mac &amp; cheese. I looked forward to making it, and enjoyed every bite too. You can never go wrong with Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese. Its a staple in my pantry.</value><value>Okay so, I used to live off this stuff in college. And I remember it being SO yummy. However I just recently made one these again, ya know, to relive the old days and wow. Its absolutely awful. Not only is the portion extremely small (maybe a normal portion for some but my appetite is endless so keep that in mind) but the cheese never fully melts into the creamy texture, leaving tiny little powdery cheese balls hidden in your Mac. Overall, these will keep you alive in a pinch, but keep your expectations low.</value><value>When i was little i loved this. It was a quick and easy way for me to eat, because i was a picky eater. I also eat now as i am older i am in college so it is a quick snack to have something in my stomach. The only thing that would make it better is if they added more cheese.</value><value>I love these little Mac n cheese instant cups!! Specially when you have little ones and you want to make a fast yummy lunch or dinner for them! Ive used these for all of my kids when they were little and even now they they are bigger lol
These actually bring memories back. They are delicious, easy and quick to make!! Microwave is the way!</value><value>I like the original box of Kraft mac n cheese, but these just don't taste the same and not in a good way. I'm also not a fan of the texture as it stay a lot more liquidy than I feel like it should. If you want it to have a better, thicker mac n cheese texture you have to microwave it a lot longer than it says on the cup</value></reviewer_comment><reviewed_date><value>March 29, 2020</value><value>May 29, 2014</value><value>January 12, 2014</value><value>May 25, 2014</value><value>March 7, 2020</value><value>March 25, 2020</value><value>March 15, 2020</value><value>March 8, 2020</value><value>March 19, 2020</value><value>March 2, 2020</value><value>March 13, 2020</value><value>March 1, 2020</value><value>March 4, 2020</value><value>March 15, 2020</value><value>March 25, 2020</value><value>March 4, 2020</value><value>March 9, 2020</value><value>March 4, 2020</value><value>March 5, 2020</value><value>March 9, 2020</value></reviewed_date></item>

The flavor is nothing like the box. I find the noodles to be harder and sometimes gummier in texture. They're also not very nutritional. Buy they are cheap. Great for hurricane supplies but otherwise we won't repurchase.</value><value>Its really good but I just don't trust the powder. Things that you can buy at the grocery store that's cheese shouldn't be powdered. However, it does taste like cheese and it is always a nice meal to give to your kids if you don't have much time to cook.</value><value>This product is good for when you dont really feel like making anything or you are trying to teach your kids to start making their own food. Although I wouldnt recommend that it is the healthiest lunch. It is very yummy. Overall I would say that this product is a 8/5 out of 10</value><value>Definitely super easy to use for lunches and they taste pretty good too. I bring them on the go, but i would like a little more product in the container. I only use it when i dont have many options for lunches, but it definitely does the job when Im hungry</value><value>I use to love these as a kid. As an adult this doesnt taste the same anymore. The cheese isnt so cheesy and the flavour is gone. Its almost water downed KD and who would like that? If they brought back the old flavour and taste I would definitely eat this again but until then no thanks you</value><value>Who doesn't love Kraft Mac&amp; Cheese? I buy this one the because if my daughter had her way she would eat it for every meal! She doesn't but I do allow her to have it for lunch a couple times a month. I don't allow her to have to much of microwaveable food plus this  is great to keep on hand and offer her a choice.</value><value>I do really enjoy the convenience of this product in both packaging and preparation time. I think it is a very good option however it definitely does not compare to the taste of the boxed mac &amp; cheese but with that sad this comes with a certain convenience</value><value>Let me start by saying that my daughter will only eat Kraft Mac and cheese out of the microwaveable bowls! I try to scoop it out onto her dinner plate, and she refuses to eat it! It is very tasty and is a staple on our pantry shelf! Very affordable and higher quality taste than store brand.</value><value>The best after school or work snack for people of all ages. The flavor is so freaking good in this mac &amp; cheese cup. The water does like to overflow a little bit when put in the microwave but its and easy clean up. I will always buy these when i go to the store.</value><value>If we make convenient Macaroni &amp; Cheese, it HAS to be Kraft.  My kids know instantly if it doesn't have the craft taste and texture.  Hardly anything else works for them. I've tried making homemade macaroni and cheese from all kinds of recipe books - nothing satisfies them - or is an easier "Dad's not home" dinner - than Kraft Macaroni and Cheese.</value><value>Dont ask me why, but this stuff is sooo much better than the box you make yourself. Its ridiculous. I lived on it after having my wisdom teeth out. Enjoyed it so much I considered having more teeth pulled just as an excuse to have my wife keep buying it. Great stuff</value><value>Great go to for easy lunches! Was actually shocked when I just added water instead of milk that is was creamy is so good. Dont like to eat Mac and cheese all the time cause Im not one for noodles but I would be so down to try a veggie noodle formula.</value><value>As much as I love the original flavor mac n cheese, i do not like the easy mac packets. maybe it's because they're cooked in the microwave but they are in my opinion watered down too much and don't have the creamy richness of the original box dinner.</value><value>I've been eating Kraft dinner since I was so little and I swear I'll never get sick of it! I use to always buy the easy mac packets but as soon as Kraft came out with these convient little cups for my lunches and on the go I was so excited! I love these!</value><value>My kids love these and they love that they can make it themselves in the microwave! These are a must have! Quick and easy! I always have cooked chicken in the fridge so they can warm up chicken and make Mac &amp; cheese for a quick lunch when were in a hurry!</value><value>As a college student this is a necessity. Great to buy in bulk and have for whenever I have a cheesy craving. Even though it's a microwavable product it still is packed with flavor and creamy goodness just like what you'd get if making this on the stove. My favorite meal to have when I am in a rush and it's always super filling</value><value>These come in handy if your in a hurry and hungry. Of course you have to like Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese :)
I like that you can make this in the microwave and not need to use a bowl.</value><value>Kraft has the best Mac and cheese ever nothing beats it. The single cup ones are easy for lunch or a single serving and quicker than making the box ones</value><value>Ive always loved these! So convenient and Im easy to make! Im quite impressed with the creamy ness and flavour of it! Takes me back to my childhood would recommend this</value><value>I used to love these but they dont give you enough cheese powder to put in them anymore. I always have to use 2 packets to give it enough flavor and it taste better if you add a little milk.</value></reviewer_comment><reviewed_date><value>March 5, 2020</value><value>February 29, 2020</value><value>March 14, 2020</value><value>March 3, 2020</value><value>February 29, 2020</value><value>March 24, 2020</value><value>March 26, 2020</value><value>March 9, 2020</value><value>March 2, 2020</value><value>March 9, 2020</value><value>March 10, 2020</value><value>March 10, 2020</value><value>March 10, 2020</value><value>March 16, 2020</value><value>March 15, 2020</value><value>March 13, 2020</value><value>April 7, 2014</value><value>April 3, 2020</value><value>April 1, 2020</value><value>April 2, 2020</value></reviewed_date></item>

I love the classic Mac taste that takes you back to childhood and I eat these quite often.</value><value>I live for these simple microwave cups because of how easy they are. I like these better than the box sometimes just because i find them to be more cheesy! Good flavor and easy to make!</value><value>I always have These in stock at my house. These are so convenient and they taste so good only take three minutes to cook its super fast. It went beyon my expectations Im very satisfied id recommend these to anybody</value><value>These cups are great when making Mac and cheese for one. They are super easy to prepare and only take a couple of minutes in the microwave. They are pretty cheap and make a great easy quick meal.</value><value>This takes me back to my college days. I used to make these all the time in college. This would be a snack while watching a movie. I personally didnt like the powder cheese as much as the other cheese though.</value><value>For what it is these aren't bad. They're probably made for children for starters, otherwise I'd complain about the poor cost effectiveness of having to eat two every time.</value><value>These were my go-to my freshman year of college. I like them because you can make them instantly and it only requires you to add water. I consider these my struggle meals but they always satisfied me.</value><value>These are so great for little kids. I love the amount in each little cup as its great for little kids. They are somewhat affordable, as I wish they were a little cheaper but I dont mind paying the price for these!</value><value>Its a very easy on the go product. Its very delicious . But when you cook it on the microwave it tends to fill out of the cup because its like boiling but its still very affordable and easy. I would definitely recommend this product</value><value>this is always a good way to send with your kid for lunches for school! its so easy to make in the microwave. it taste the same as if you make it on the stove. im pleased with this easy mac</value><value>Im not a fan of the texture of the Easy Mac. It tastes okay but its a bit soggy for me. And I find its expensive compared to other Kraft Dinner products.</value><value>I really like the microwaveable version of this easy mac &amp; cheese just because it is so quick and when you need that quick fix it is really easy to make! It is also really cheap, and can make for a great snack or meal if you choose.</value><value>Super easy and fast in a pinch! Whether its lunch at work or dinner for the kids when they wont eat the gourmet beef stroganoff Julia Childs prepares for them! But always have this in the cupboard for quick easy delicious fix</value><value>Great on the go snack for all ages!!!! Easy to make and quick to make in seconds and taste the best. Sometimes I even prefer this Mac and cheese then more  expensive supposedly better tasting brands.</value><value>I love kraft Mac and cheese and this makes my favorite food a lot easier to have because all you have to do is add water then put it in the microwave!</value><value>I usually buy Mac and cheese for my kids and I we love it mostly because they come in good sized little bowls to have a decent quantity. It has such a good flavor and I love taking these little bowls to work too !</value><value>I dont personally like it, because the flavor is missing. Many people like it but i dont really like it, i would recommend to add spices or stuffs in it if you are really intrested to try it</value><value>This is a really good macaroni and cheese especially if you need a quick lunch or dinner. It is also really easy to cook which is really efficient for people that dont know how to cook. I would totally recommend to everyone.</value><value>This stuff is a classic children's mac n cheese dinner, but as an adult, I really never want to eat this stuff.

Theyre decently portioned so when youre craving mac n cheese you dont go overboard.

Otherwise, its a great, SUPER EASY to prepare, little meal on its own!</value><value>My children are the Mack and cheese eaters in this house.

That's why I love these individual bowls. There quick to make also with me it doesn't make me want to eat the left overs of them ( if any ) it's the perfect portion for me. 1 thing I wish they could fix is to make them a tad cheaper. Oh and it would be great if they experimented with NEW FLAVORS.</value><value>I have been buying these fo a while now. My girls used to only eat these. They preferred them over the box until they got a little bit older not it has switched. They like to have these when they are so hungry and 3 mins is faster than waiting for water to build for the box. Plus the cup is the perfect size for my youngest.</value><value>These things are a life saver and they are sooo delicious! i use these for my kids dinner about 4 out of 7 days of the week!

We keep these on hand for a quick addition to a meal or for a snack. My son is super picky and sometimes this is all he wants to eat. We still make him try whatever we are having, but Mac and cheese is always a winner.</value><value>I wish the containers were bigger but it's such an easy to-go item and you can heat it up anywhere where you have access to a microwave. It's really good mac n cheese but it doesn't really fill you up, great as a snack though. I usually take them to school with me.</value><value>I love this mac n cheese! It tastes great and is convenient to fix and eat. Add some salsa or some hot sauce for an extra flavor....so delicious! The cheese is in a pouch and easy to squeeze and it is creamy and delicious!

It takes so little of my time to make myself a serving which leaves me more time to spend on studying rather than cooking for 40 mins</value><value>Kraft Easy Mac Original Flavor Macaroni &amp; Cheese Dinner pasta mix paired with Velvetta Cheese from Kraft is a real comfort food for most of us.

I try and keep this stocked in my home because me and my significant other live Mac and cheese. Its convenient for sure especially when we both work so much and simply dont have time sometimes to make dinner. Its simply to make and oh so tasty.</value><value>This is such a convenient way to eat Mac n cheese. It's  also easy and fun for children to make for themselves. Each serving has just the right amount. I personally use the coffee machine to warm my water up instead of microwaving the whole thing. It's ready to eat within minutes. No dishes to clean and everyone's happy! They're affordable and available everywhere. I'd recommend this product to all my family and friends.</value><value>I used to love eating these when I was in need of food in a pinch at work, always easy to make and yummy. But it seems that they've changed the way they've made it? Not as good as they used to be, and the noodles seem to have some weird gooey texture and doesn't mix well with the cheese and leaves it clumpy and gross</value><value>These are the most handiest little cuos ever.  With 3 kids and 2 play sports all yr round they come in handy for a after school snack till after practice then dinner. They can eat it in the car and it's the right 1 cup portion . I buy these all the time. Depending on where you shop you can get them really cheap.</value><value>These are a big hit in the afternoon when the kids get out of school. They will sit and make a meal out of these. I only find the second to one other brand. Thats why I gave it four instead of five. They are creamy and rich flavored. And the kids find them easy to make.</value><value>This isn't as good as the box but it's a decent substitute. I give these to my son when he doesnt want the food we are making for dinner or take them for lunch when I haven't meal prepped. It's super simple to make and is a good substitute for the traditional boxed mac n cheese.</value><value>My kids love these little mac and cheese bowls, it really easy to make, they only take 3 minutes in the microwave, I literally buy them all the time, and my kids always eat them all really fast we go through them a lot, so I'm always buying them a lot ! They taste great to especially compared to the generic ones if you ever tried the generic ones kraft are way better, the generic ones the noddled get mushy</value><value>I like these. They are easy to use and the perfect size for little ones but are just a snack size for my older kids. Sometimes I add the powder too soon and mess it all up. The noodles have a thickening kind of powder In it thats kind of weird but I get it so it not just chunky or goopy or dry. My kids love it.</value><value>These are exactly what i remember from when i was a little kid and i begged my mom to buy them at the store and make it for me as soon as we got home. I get that its definitely not homemade and with tons of artificial flavoring. But its nostalgic. Although its a tad small for me now. Its a perfect easy snack on the go.</value><value>Are used to eat so many kraft macaroni and cheese singles when I was in high school and college! Its fast , easy and tastes great! It definitely met my expectations and I would buy the bigger version of this macaroni and cheese because it is cheaper!</value><value>Just add some water, microwave for 3.5 mins and mix in the pack of cheese. You have the same mac n cheese from the box in less than 5 minutes, and in individual portions. I use it to feed my toddler since it saves me time, and a whole box would go to waste.</value><value>Kraft Easy Mac is one of the best meal inventions of all time.  It is super easy to make and is tasty.  My kids love that they can make Easy Mac themselves for a snack.  This is something we purchase repeatedly.  I would definitely recommend this product.</value></reviewer_comment><reviewed_date><value>January 12, 2020</value><value>January 12, 2020</value><value>February 26, 2020</value><value>January 23, 2020</value><value>February 3, 2020</value><value>January 11, 2020</value><value>February 7, 2020</value><value>February 8, 2020</value><value>January 29, 2020</value><value>February 27, 2020</value><value>January 21, 2020</value><value>January 25, 2020</value><value>February 11, 2020</value><value>January 17, 2020</value><value>January 29, 2020</value><value>January 18, 2020</value><value>January 19, 2020</value><value>February 14, 2020</value><value>February 10, 2020</value><value>January 4, 2020</value></reviewed_date></item>

These aren't as good as fresh made mac and cheese but these are goid in a pinch or when you really need to satisfy that craving. These are easy to make in my office using the microwave and they come together very quick.</value><value>Classic Kraft mac and cheese! Honestly its a lot of first childrens favorite food and i can definitely see why!! Its also one of the best side dishes for so many great dishes!! I would definitely recommend this to anybody that knows a picky eater out there!</value><value>I LOVE Easy Mac! It is so good! Honestly one of my favorite things to eat! I wish I could eat it more. Its easy to prepare and take to school/work but Its not super filling. I could probably eat two. They arent super cheap either but cheaper than going out.</value><value>Bought these for my  son,as he is a picky eater and if he likes something,I will buy it in bulk! Well,he LOVES these! He eats one pretty much every day! It's easy enough,he can put water in it and microwave it himself. So he feels like he is capable of accomplishing some things himself. Great price,great product,and happy kiddo!</value><value>This is the best quality products that has been made to use by all the people and all the people in your lovely family needing to try out this extremely excellent product product quality in every detail of the package you can also feel house luxury it feel in your hand it make you want to come back for more</value><value>Ok no other Mac n cheese compares to Kraft. Its the only kinda my kids will eat. What I love about these single cups is my 9 year old can make them herself! Perfect for an easy lunch or as a dinner side dish for the kiddos who only eat chicken nuggets and Mac n cheese</value><value>We love these because theyre easy to make and pack. I love that when I have 3 children asking for different things that this can be popped in the microwave and one them has lunch in 3 minutes without having to make and waste a whole box of Mac and cheese</value><value>Easy Mac Kraft dinner used to be the first thing my brother and I would make when we would arrive home from school. It was fast and easy to make, even in elementary school. Anyway I love Kraft dinner so this is a 5/5 for me. Who doesn't like cheese..</value><value>These are such a big hit with my kids.... and me :) we love them! Theyre so easy to make you just add water to the line marked in the cup so no guessing then just pop in the microwave for approximately 3 1/2 minutes, add the cheese, and boom... youre done. Taste delicious because the texture comes out perfect and theres tons of cheese.</value><value>I think this product isn't the best. It is rather cheap but the taste is not as great as Velveeta cheese mac and cheese. I would improve this product but making a better cheese sauce. I used to eat this brand all the time as a kid. A few times as an adult. I would not recommend this much to others considering if they have taste like me they would not enjoy it as much as they should.</value><value>I love the controlled portion size of this pack, because believe me, I can eat a whole box by myself. Also, who doesnt love Kraft Mac n Cheese? Its so yummy and creamy, with just enough saltiness. Its easy to make as well. It makes dinner so fast and easy!</value><value>The best mac and cheese brand. This is a quick and easy side dish or main meal. I like that the mac and cheese doesn't take very long to cook and it only requires three basic ingredients; water, milk, and butter. I forgo the milk and just add extra butter.</value><value>This is super helpful for college students like me who may need a quick and easy snack. Although this kind is not as good as the original, it is very simple and quick when im on the go. This does not taste the same as the original, doesnt have much flavor, gets extremely hot in the microwave, and the noodles come out very mushy. However, it does fill my belly when I need a quick and easy snack!</value><value>This is quick and easy to make when you are on the go. When I was in college I would buy this due to it being cheap but also filling. I know bring it to work with me due to it being easy to prepare. Add milk or water and place it in the microwave. In a few mins you have a wonderful lunch or dinner.</value><value>It doesnt matter how old you are, Kraft Mac and Cheese is a go to! I eat this for lunch very often- almost weekly. The cups are great and super convenient. However, even if you fill to the line or a little under the line, the water can over flow and make a big mess in the microwave!</value><value>Kraft Easy Mac Original Flavor Macaroni &amp; Cheese Dinner cups have been a staple to lunch in our home. As a mom that both works from home and homeschools her three children,  Kraft Easy Mac has been a lunch favorite for both my kids and I. It's easy enough for the kids to prepare and little to no mess. The portion size is great. I highly recommend parents to keep these in the house for those easy and quick to fix lunches.</value><value>Macaroni and cheese is one of my 6 year olds favorite meals at our house! But sometimes he wants it when the rest of us dont! Thats why I love these cups! They are quick and super easy to prepare! It ends up being the perfect portion with him! We like to pair it with some hotdogs or even broccoli! We always make sure to have these on hand!</value><value>Even though Kraft is a name brand its product leaves bad taste in your mouth, quite literally. The powdered cheese is downright disgusting. If you add the suggested amount of water to the product it's too soupy once it comes out of the microwave. Skip this and buy Velveeta.</value><value>I love these it's small so it's good for traveling or packing a lunch. I eat this quiet often when low on money, I would improve by adding bigger packaging and more of a selection. I love the cheese flavor, it's really smooth and creamy. I recommend this to everyone</value><value>These are great! I love to take these to work for my lunches. They aren't the healthiest, but they are a treat once and a while. I love how you can just pop them in a microwave. It takes the exact same as the box kraft dinner.

I eat it about once a month and recommend it to others!</value><value>Love the easy side items! My family and everyone I know has grew up eating Kraft Macaroni &amp; Cheese. It is so easy to cook these Easy Macs. Add water &amp; pop in the microwave for a few mins. I especially like the convenience of these little guys when I am in a rush to get dinner or lunch served. I will always have Kraft Easy Mac Original Flavor Macaroni &amp; Cheese dinner in my cupboards.</value><value>Perfect when youre in a rush and need something quick! I try not to eat it too often as its not a very healthy option but it tastes great! I grew up on Kraft Mac and Cheese and even after trying other brands, I always come back to Kraft! The flavor and consistency are my favorite!</value><value>I love these! My favorite brand of Mac and cheese because I love yellow cheese so much! Its also childhood! I like the easy Mac cups because you dont have to wait 5 min for hot water to boil then pour the macaroni and then wait for it tocook then cheese it which takes forever. Instead you pop this guy in the microwave for about 2 minutes and sprinkle the cheese and your done! I kick and easy!</value><value>My child loves macaroni and cheese and this makes the perfect afternoon snack when shes starving. A quick pop in the microwave and shes ready to go, not to mention its also a perfect lunch treat for an exhausted momma who needs something quick and easy to make</value><value>Kraft brand is likley the most preferred brand I buy. Since 1975 I have ate Kraft macaroni and cheese sometimes weekly sometimes 3 days a week. These newer microwave singles are pretty good. They aren't the same as the kind you make at home on the stove. But they did good getting it as similiar as possible</value><value>Mac n cheese is one of my favorite things to eat, and Im a very small adult and I dont always eat very much, these are perfect for me to take with me to work for my lunch! I will say they usually dont fill me up, so if youre someone that eats a decent amount of food, you would want the actual boxes of Mac n cheese as these are pretty small, they work really great for kids too!</value><value>My kids and myself love these. When ever I crave mac and cheese I'll eat one or two of these. they have good taste and if made right are cheesy. I think they are a little high in price of just a pack of four the only reason I buy is because of my kids and the kids I babysit</value><value>It's an alright cup of mac and cheese. Great for dorm life because it's quick and convenient. Pretty affordable. Not as good as what's in the box. There typically isnt enough cheese sauce to coat everything, and it tends to clump so its uneven in flavor.</value><value>I have POTS so this is something I can make quick as a college student and sprinkle a ton of salt on to help me hold my fluids! Not to mention it's flavor is pretty great too, especially if you add peas, ham, or extra cheese. Honestly one of my "guilty pleasure" dinners to make!</value><value>This is so easy to just pop in the microwave and let it cook then you add your cheese flavoring, and yum in the tum it's done. It is priced very reasonably and packaged well. Tastes great and never disappoints my taste buds. Very satisfied with this product.</value><value>I think this is a very convenient way to make Mac n cheese. If you dont have enough time just add milk or water, pop it in the microwave for 3 minutes and youre good to go. It taste delicious and has a nice consistency. Only issue is that it is snack sized, for me at least. I typically eat a whole kraft box myself.</value><value>Maybe I'm simple but I still love original Kraft Mac and Cheese. I've been eating this stuff since I was a kid and it's definitely one of my comfort foods. I don't eat it frequently, but these cups are super convenient for a quick lunch at work. I will continue to buy on occasion.</value><value>Kraft Mac and cheese is the best other than homemade in the oven mac and cheese. And this little guy us awesome.  Quick and easy. Makes for a quick little snack and great fir the kids fir an after school snack. Very satisfied with it and definitely recommend it if you haven't tried it already.</value><value>Not very healthy but so great in a pinch for days at work. Its easy to prepare, fast to cook, has the flavor of macaroni you make on the stove and obviously easy to carry with you for work or wherever. Its not necessarily healthy by any means but if youre not too concerned its a good choice.</value><value>I do not eat Kraft macaroni from the box anymore, so this is soo perfect and convenient! It tastes just like the regular boxed one, but gets done much quicker! It comes in a disposable microwaveable bowl, with the cheese sauce packet apart. All you do is just add water, microwave for three minutes, stir in the cheese sauce powder, and voil!</value><value>I personally love these. I think they taste just like the box that you boil and they only take about 3.5 minutes to cook in the microwave. Theyre good for packed lunch because all you need is water and access to a microwave. My only problem with these is that they could stand to be a little larger portion.</value><value>This Microwavable Mac and cheese is perfect for on the go or Snack Time or both!  We enjoy this when we aren't in the mood to make a whole box, Great for late night snack when the kids are asleep.</value><value>Kraft is our go to Mac and cheese. It seems better than all the other brands, it's very cheesy and it has a good flavor to it. It's probably not healthy for you but it's pretty good, and easy to make</value><value>This is one  Mac&amp;cheese I prefers to have when I am too lazy to go to my dining hall.

Its great for packing on the go and warming in a microwave. Very light weight and convenient. Very satisfied with the size</value><value>I love these things! Theyre perfect little snacks for on the go or at home! I get the 4 pack so they last me a while, Ill eat these at work or just when Im at home and need lunch! They are affordable and I would recommend to others!</value><value>Maybe its the way I made it but it was very watery and not that cheesy. It did not meet my expectations, I was highly disappointed. It would have been better if they gave more cheese powder. I havent bought another one since...</value><value>I LOVE these mac and cheese packs! These are so convenient, whether you're scarfing down food during a work break, or you don't feel like dirtying dishes and cooking on the stove. I had mac and cheese constantly as a kid...if only my babysitters could've had access to these decades ago! I like to bring these packs to work and they're a major hit with my coworkers. I personally like to slightly alter the directions. Rather than filling the container to the line before putting it in the microwave, I like to just barely cover all of the noodles with water (usually filling to a centimeter or two below the line), then microwave, then pour cold water up to the line. This speeds up the cooling down process, allowing me to consume the mac and cheese within five minutes.</value><value>This is a really good mac &amp; cheese I always go to craft mac &amp; cheese because it always has the best flavor this one is really easy to make. I eat them at least 2 to 3 times a week I always recommend to them to other people because they taste amazing and kids love them.</value><value>I'm sorry but Kraft Dinner is disgusting. I love Mac n Cheese and I just can't stomach this. For me, it's that awful powder that turns into cheese that just throws me off. I know it's cheap and so many people enjoy it, but UGH- I just can't. Makes me sad because I want to eat an abundance of Mac n Cheese.</value><value>I love this product because I can be lazy and or rushed sometimes and this is quick and easy if I want a small snack I'll get the small bowl if I'm a little hungry or I can purchase the larger Bowl has a delicious flavor it doesn't taste strange even though it's cooked in the microwave the price is great and if you have kids I would suggest stocking up</value><value>Sounds and looks gross but... never judge a book by its cover. This stuff is seriously good! And soooo easy! Perfect for camping, snacking on the go, students, etc! It turns out being very creamy after its done in the microwave. It doesnt taste just like normal boxed kraft dinner, so it changes it up and actually tastes super good!</value><value>Love these products. Great flavor and a family favorite. Everything taste amazing. Would not change anything about the product. I would recommend to others as it appeals so much to the children. Also have some on hand. Will continue to buy the product.</value><value>This is great if you don't want to make a full meal and this is quick and easy to do. I wouldn't say it's very healthy but they have ones where it's less sodium you can find. This brand is a brand I trust and have been using for some time and their pretty affordable in price.</value><value>This was such a convenience when our daughter went off to college. I could offer her a bit of home while she was out and on the go to classes or stuck in the dorms on a rainy day. We bought these in a large box size, so she had a stocked supply. Thanks for making it possible for us to provide easily accessible comfort food. And she loved it!</value><value>Kraft Easy Mac Original Flavor Macaroni &amp; Cheese Dinner pasta mix paired with Velvetta Cheese from Kraft is a real comfort food for most of us. Not only does it taste great but is economical to purchase and prepare . There is also nutrition as Velvetta is manufactured from dairy products which combined with pasta elbows makes with the sauce package a truly great meal.</value><value>I eat these all the time. When I was a freshman in college this was a quick and easy late night study snack. So easy to make and tastes the same as when you make it on the stove. These are definitely my favorite in terms of cheap and easy study food.</value><value>The Kraft Easy Mac was very convenient and easy when I was in collage. Everyone knows how broke collage kids usually are and I mainly survived off of this stuff. It was pretty good for being something quick and easy. I'd definitely recommend for all the other struggling college kids.</value><value>This is still as good as the first day I tried it. Its creamy and cheesy flavor is just so good! What can I say It's all kids favorite. Now I'm hungry again. To bad I'm in a diet. Does it has real vitamins in the package? I like how it comes in a little cup.</value><value>I'm a college student so I can not explain how much I use these. They are so easy to make and taste so good. It definitely meet my expectations and is so easy to make in my dorm. They are super affordable even for a college student. I would recommend for anyone kids, teens, or adult.</value><value>This is a great go to for an after school snack or a quick dinner or lunch. The quick convenient product is a go to for our household when we need something and dinner isn't planned. The taste is good and it's super easy to make. The packaging is nice and easy to use</value><value>Anything with Kraft already hits close to home for me, as eating their dinner packs were a big part of my childhood. I almost view them as a type of comfort food. So personally, I find their Mac &amp; Cheese to be very soft, creamy, and flavourful. The package is also easy to prepare and works well if you're in a time crunch.</value><value>I love mac &amp; cheese it is quick and easy. It has a good flavor. This is great to give your baby one starting them on table food. Definitely met my expectations. I love that you can make this so quick for your loved ones on the nights that you dont have much energy to cook dinner.</value><value>Can't go wrong with some good ol' KD. Its part of my childhood growing up with my sisters making mac n cheese for lunch. Its cheap delicious and quick. I feel like start to finish its about 15minutes.

My kids use to love these. Its easy to prepare and he loved these. He super picky. But i just dont like the powder cheese product. The color Itself makes you feel like you know its got so many probably unhealthy additives</value><value>We love these! My daughter is a Mac and Cheese fiend but refuses left overs. These cups are perfect portion sizes and added bonus, she can make it herself now! I should probably be ashamed to admit how often these are in her dinner rotations but she is a picky 9 year old and sometimes it is just easier to give her what she likes than fight and send her to bed hungry.</value><value>I love these cuz they are quick &amp; easy !! I do not cook,so if I can't microwave it....or open an eat it I usually don't eat it !! These typically run for a reasonable price and the lil bit of extra $$ I pay for is worth it to me.Becasue in my opinion KRAFT mac &amp; cheese is SO much better than the off brands !! That's just my personal opinion.....</value><value>These were a life saver in college and late nights! And still are! Im obsessed with eating these as a snack or just something to hold me down. I can also flavor it with salt and pepper or hot sauce to change it up and still tastes perfect! I cant recommend this enough</value><value>These are my go-to! I love them. Theyre very easy to make as you just add water and you put them in the product. I havent had them in awhile but when I do get them, Ill eat them a few times a month, Theyre a nice treat for me since I am lactose intolerant; it really does remind me of my childhood. The only thing I do wish is that they have a slightly bigger size you can purchase. I usually need to eat 2-3 of these to really feel satisfied.</value><value>I meant to select the original box not the microwave cup. The box has its own taste and Its the only one I like. It's cheap and easy to make.  It's not something I would serve giest for dinner but its definitely something I would serve myself.  Its making me want some now.  I recommend this brand and product.</value><value>This is one of the easiest, and most delicious lunches or snacks you can get.  Super fast in the microwave, super easy to make, you really can't go wrong with Easy Mac!  My 2 year old LOVES this, and she is a picky one!  Not very healthy, but when you're a busy parent on a budget....who cares?</value><value>These are super easy to make and then I get them for my family all the time. Its a great after school snack for kids and its super easy to make and its very hard to mess it up in there doesnt really need to be an Adult supervision. Highly recommend I will purchase again.</value><value>Perfection in a microwaveable cup.</value><value>This is a quick college snack for a college student.</value><value>Super snack the kids can fix themselves.</value><value>When every I am craving some Mac and cheese I always go for this. It is so easy to make and is ready in minutes. It also taste amazing</value><value>Like any cheese product Kraft meal is great so if you plan to have a light snack one 2.05 oz. should be enough but for dinner I recommend 2.</value><value>My kids love these. I have bought the Valvedere brand and it is great too, but its really hard to beat kraft mac &amp; cheese!</value><value>The traditional kraft Mac and cheese taste that takes 1/4 the time to make! Quick and easy for when my kids need a meal!</value><value>You could buy this cheaper at a grocery store but it was easy for me to just get it then. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]</value><value>These are good for quick and easy snacks for kids, or when you have picky eaters that wont eat the same foods, that way you dont have to waste a pot</value><value>Kraft is one of my favorites. Quick, easy, and super yummy macaroni &amp; cheese! The small ones are even easy to bring with you when you are on the go!</value><value>Easy macaroni and cheese. Easy and quick instruction. This met my expectations maybe even better than my expectations.</value><value>These really come in handy when you dont feel like cooking it in a pot you can just pop it in the microwave and its ready in 10 mins</value></reviewer_comment><reviewed_date><value>December 20, 2019</value><value>November 27, 2019</value><value>December 6, 2019</value><value>November 13, 2019</value><value>December 26, 2019</value><value>November 2, 2019</value><value>December 19, 2019</value><value>December 11, 2019</value><value>May 24, 2016</value><value>October 13, 2014</value><value>August 9, 2016</value><value>April 11, 2020</value><value>July 29, 2016</value><value>April 12, 2020</value><value>April 4, 2020</value><value>July 28, 2017</value><value>March 30, 2020</value><value>April 12, 2020</value><value>April 5, 2020</value><value>March 30, 2020</value></reviewed_date></item>

It has the same great taste and I only make enough for myself.</value><value>Love love the Mac &amp; Cheese dinner that Kraft has. I always am glad to have it. Very easy to prepare and very fast.

Just enjoy the food while you have it and eat it all gone</value><value>I love Mac and cheese and I absolutely love this brand. I dont eat this very often because i am lactose intolerant but this is very affordable and its just great. I used to eat this I a lot when I was little.</value><value>these are super convenient when your hungry but not starving. kraft has always been delicious. super cheesy!! doesnt take long at all to make. and perfect portion size.</value><value>These are not as good as the stove top version, but microwave food never is. They're convenient for picky kids, and maybe a quick grab lunch for running out the doorwhen you're late for work. But their overall taste is meh.</value><value>Genuinely the only thing that got em through college and saved Thanksgiving for my daughter. Wish they didnt boil over so quickly, but Im sure thats on me.</value><value>The original flavour is the fan favourite in our house. These are great for a fast lunch. They are not the healthiest thing. They are easy on my pocket book when bought in bulk.</value><value>Quick and great for an easy snack if you cant get a full meal. I ate these a lot overseas. Quick tip add tuna to make it tastier.

When Im in a hurry and cant pack a lunch I grab one of these and still get excited once lunch time rolls around</value><value>So easy and affordable, great for a quick lunch or snack.

This is what every adult dreams of when they think of their childhood. Its soft and creamy and cheesy and perfect. Love it and will continue to eat it forever.</value><value>Easy to grab, fast to make, and pretty good flavor for microwave meals. Not too bad for $1 each (average). I do wish they were a little bigger. Sometimes one is just not enough, but two is a little too much.</value><value>I love how easy it is to make this when you want a quick snack or for my child. Add some water, 3 minutes in the microwave and its done.

They taste watery compared to the Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese box noodles. The portion size of this is also small which doesnt make for a meal.</value><value>Im not exactly great with the stove, so I love these kraft cups. They literally take 5 minutes to make. All you need to do is add some water and pop the cup in the blender! Super easy to make and sooo delicious.</value><value>Childhood in a box. Seriously this just hits different. Its good any time of the day and can be an entree or side item. No matter how sophisticated your palette is, this stuff is just plain good.</value><value>Im a big fan of the Kraft Mac and cheese. I like to purchase these for my son it really easy to make and also my son is a big fan of cheese. The taste is really good.

I always have them at the house.</value><value>These are a easy and quick lunch side for my daughter on days we dont have the time to make a full lunch! It also helps that she loves them and the different themes they come in!</value><value>This is my 2 year old little boys favorite dinner, sometimes even breakfast haha. He calls it cheez and he asks for it often, so we have to buy it by the big box lol. We are pretty happy with this product because its quick and easy!</value><value>My daughters love these Mac and cheese cups and I wont buy any brand but Kraft!!  It has always been a trusted brand and has great flavor! Overall very satisfied!</value><value>I love having these around when your in a pinch sometimes work gets busy and I dont have time to leave to grab something this can just chill in my desk and I dont have to worry about it spoiling and when I need something quick bam! Theres lunch</value><value>I eat this for lunch and dinner and theyre so easy to make! Kraft is the only brand I buy from for Mac and cheese and my family goes through these sooo fast! So yummy and flavorful!</value><value>I do not like these. Bought it once and honestly I can never get it again. It had an awful consistency and flavour to it. I really enjoy regular Mac and Cheese by Kraft but this was just gross</value><value>I love these little Mac and cheese bowls. Its perfect for a quick meal or even to make as a dinner side. Super easy and it eliminates making a mess in the kitchen.</value><value>This is OK in a pinch but quite disappointing compared to the original box to Mac and cheese. It makes a huge mess in the microwave every time on the water boils over and consistently can be very gummy.</value><value>You know what they say " it's the cheesiest ' this stuff is the bomb !! Super yummy.!! I add in some extra cheese to mine and maybe top with some fresh tomatoes , OMG it's so good</value><value>Quick, easy and very helpful to have on hand. Great for those pocket eaters. As good for the little ones as it is for adults. Eliminates the need for a stovetop version.</value><value>I absolutely love easy mag because it is delicious, convenient, and pre-packaged for individual consumption. Not everyone needs to make an entire family sized box when they want macaroni and cheese. This is a perfect solution to that problem.</value><value>My two teenagers (16/13) love these Kraft Mac and cheese bowls. They can take them to school for lunch which is great. Its super easy to make. Its fast and convenient. Cant complain about them.</value><value>These are great for when you have to work or just need a single serving. All you do is add water and put it in the microwave. Its easy to make and the flavour is there. Its not as good as out of the box but its still good.</value><value>This is definitely something that you can grab quick to make when you have to make something fast and kids seem to enjoy it. It is pretty processed but the price is cheap and it is a fast thing to make when time is not on your side</value><value>This is about the only thing my 2 and 3 year old will eat! We went a little while where my 3 year old wouldnt touch anything to eat, unless it was Mac and cheese! She still adores this food and has consumed two bowls today!</value></reviewer_comment><reviewed_date><value>January 18, 2020</value><value>January 27, 2020</value><value>January 18, 2020</value><value>February 11, 2020</value><value>January 30, 2020</value><value>February 13, 2020</value><value>February 13, 2020</value><value>January 27, 2020</value><value>January 10, 2020</value><value>January 10, 2020</value><value>January 24, 2020</value><value>February 7, 2020</value><value>January 3, 2020</value><value>February 6, 2020</value><value>February 3, 2020</value><value>January 15, 2020</value><value>February 17, 2020</value><value>January 7, 2020</value><value>January 26, 2020</value><value>February 4, 2020</value></reviewed_date></item>

Tastes great, not really artificial flavor and hasnt that much calories. Totally recommend</value><value>My kids love it but me not so much!

They are also really easy to pack up and take on a trip plus all you need is water and a microwave to make it.</value><value>Whenever I am late to school I always just pop this in my backpack for lunch.

However it is still a good way of staying not being hungry and I will recommend.</value><value>My kid loves these as a little snack or meal with some fruit and veggies! They are easy to make since you just pop them in the microwave for three minutes. Has the same great kraft taste.</value><value>These are the easiest way to get in a meal quickly if youre in a rush or dont have a lot of time. They are so delicious and filling and seriously take less than five minutes to make.</value><value>These are super handy to toss in my son's lunch with a bottle of water.

Theyre perfect if you live in a dorm or just want something quick and easy. Theyre also very delicious and cheesey!</value><value>This is honestly a original item that probably everyone used sometime in their life, it does the job and is good! Though recommend the boxed one since it tastes better since these come out watery.</value><value>Great on the go snack or if you dont wanna wait for it to cook on the stove the microwavable ones taste just as good.

Super easy for someone without access to a kitchen all the time.</value><value>My granddaughter loves these because I let her make her own, but I still prefer the original Mac and cheese on the stovetop only because I can add more milk or butter if needed.But this easy to make is a winner with kids and adults alike.</value><value>This certainly isnt some gourmet mac and cheese but Id say its definitely good enough. Its quick and easy to make, doesnt dirty and bowls/dishes, tastes perfectly fine, and is filling.

Perfect prices and easy lists instructions! No additional ingredients needed!</value><value>Being in college and broke you tend to eat these a lot.

To get rid of that, I either put hot sauce in it or crunch up Doritos Flamin Hot chips.</value><value>Great product for a quick, cheap, and easy meal.

Good taste for a microwaveable meal, and overall satisfied each time!</value><value>I buy these for my younger brother to eat when hes at my house, because theyre just easy to pop in the microwave! He loves them and hasnt complained. Very satisfied and affordable.</value><value>This stuff is currently getting me through dorm life!!! Its so simple to prepare and doesnt take long at all! I give 4 stars because it isnt quite as good as the kind made on the stove, but thats to be expected. I still looove it!</value><value>I think it is great. It tastes just like you cooked it in a pot but it is easier.  It wouldn't improve this product because it is already awesome. This product met every expectation. I am very satisfied with the product.</value><value>Easy Mac is just that, easy. It gets the job done when you want a little mac and cheese but don't want to wait for water to boil or to make a whole pot.</value><value>I prefer Kraft Mac and cheese over any other, including home made!

It's not so filling that they wont eat dinner it's just enough to get them by before dinner. Very very affordable and inexpensive so it's a go to for my kids</value><value>I have 4 young kids and all of them are obsessed with these. Its the regular Mac n cheese but apparently it makes it much more exciting if served out of these ore packaged bowls :)</value></reviewer_comment><reviewed_date><value>January 22, 2020</value><value>February 16, 2020</value><value>January 4, 2020</value><value>January 26, 2020</value><value>February 23, 2020</value><value>January 5, 2020</value><value>January 13, 2020</value><value>February 20, 2020</value><value>February 21, 2020</value><value>January 25, 2020</value><value>January 11, 2020</value><value>January 9, 2020</value><value>January 3, 2020</value><value>February 4, 2020</value><value>February 21, 2020</value><value>February 27, 2020</value><value>January 29, 2020</value><value>February 12, 2020</value><value>February 27, 2020</value><value>January 27, 2020</value></reviewed_date></item>

The best Mac and cheese out there!</value><value>Easy to cook. Just fill it up with water put it in the microwave and its ready.

This was my dinner for a couple of days during collage. Easy heating instructions, tastes great, and a perfect portion size.</value><value>As a college student these are great for a quick meal before class or if I had to skip out on a meal during the day.

Literally just add water and you can use for microwave to cook ! Super easy snack if you are in a hurry ! These are a little expensive compared to the box ! But still affordable and delicious!</value><value>this is a great product if you looking to make an easy meal. it is easy to make and it is also inexpensive. no this product isn't the healthiest, but after a long day and if you are in a rush, you can use this product and it does the job.</value><value>Really easy and quick to make (4-5 mins) and they are somewhat affordable, especially in packs with multiple.

You just add water, pop it in the microwave, and then stir the cheese in. It is perfect and quick to make!</value><value>I think these things are gross and never fully cook the noodles. Plus they talk about the cheese powder having bad things in it. Dont buy these anymore</value><value>Classic and delicious: it never fails! Every Canadian home deserves at least a few of these on hand. Just add a bit of ketchup and it tastes even better.

I love the single serving cups, all you do is add water versus making the box kind with butter and milk. This product is creamy and is done in 3 minutes, my kids love this</value><value>If it isnt homemade, we always use kraft! The price matches the quantity and its a childhood favorite. Can you really go wrong?? Always been a great side or easy snack to pull together!</value><value>OK so these arent the best for you but when youre hungry and when you are in a hurry Or lets say lunch break at work these are great!

So easy for when youre hungry but dont know what you want to eat or are too lazy to make anything. Always such a great comfort food if youve had a bad day and need a little pick me up</value><value>These cups straight up dont cook right. They didnt when I was a kid, and they dont now. They always end up way too watery with poorly cooked pasta. In my opinion it is tastier and cheaper to just make KD at home.</value><value>My kid seriously would eat these for every single meal if I let him. He loves this make and cheese and its easy and fast to pop in the microwave as a snack</value><value>Great quick lunch to grab at work! Great taste and great value!

Filling proportion. Great price. Easy to make, is ready in minutes! Simple yummy dinner.</value><value>Love these for being quick and easy to make on the go and on a busy day. I dont eat them anymore but I do have them handy for trips where Im staying in a hotel.</value><value>Doesnt taste quite like the KD that is popular but great for on the go. I generally buy these while travelling or staying at hotels, not good for you and kinda pricy but in my opinion it tastes good and its worth it.</value><value>This is the best Mac and cheese that your taste buds with ever meet with! If you never tried these before, you have too! They are so easy to make with no mess! I usually have these as a nice lunch food</value><value>I like these cute little mac n cheese cups. They are perfect for my nieces. They are quick and they like the taste. I just wish they were a little cheaper</value><value>These are great for kids who are old enough to measure out some water and use the microwave! These little cups are a bit expensive for macaroni and cheese, but they are very convenient at times, and worth the extra cost.</value><value>I never eat Max &amp; cheese because of the fat and carbs it has. However, if I ever break my diet for Mac &amp; cheese, its always for Kraft! Its the best flavor ever. I dont think Ive tried any better one so far!</value><value>The taste of this product is great. It takes very little time to make which is great. depending on how its prepared it can be very cheesy or sometimes you can add even more cheese and cover the lid to melt for extra cheese.</value><value>These Mac and cheese cups make lunches so easy, and tasty! The cups are decently priced for the convenience factor, and are definitely a usual in my grocery cart</value><value>Its decent microwaveable snack. Its easy to make and easy to screw up as well. Its one of those things you eat without thinking or when you dont want to think about what youre eating. Its cheap.</value><value>Always a great snack , super  quick and easy to prepare especially when your in a hurry , krafts got the good stuff , great taste as always ..... cant get enough of these , definitely recommend these</value><value>Broke college student? Dont worry, just buy this. Its not healthy, but it taste better than healthy. Trust me I could eat 5 bowls in one sitting &amp; you still have money left over bc of how cheap they are.

They eat these about twice a week. And the absolutely love them. I would suggest that they make them in bigger bowls. They were extremely affordable.  Overall I am very satisfied with this product.</value><value>This is a quick and easy product that my kids can pop in the microwave themselves.  My kids love it and I prefer them to eat this rather than junk food.  It taste great. Just add water then the sauce pack and you have a great addition to any meal,</value><value>I got this for my son and he ate it up so quickly. He loves Mac and cheese and this is a perfect amount for him. Its super cheap! He eats it probably every other week or so.</value><value>What kid doesnt love some good Mac n Cheese? I give these to the kids when I babysit and they LOVE them! Plus, it only takes some water and less than a few minutes in the microwave and voila! Its done!</value><value>If you like the original than this is worth a try. It took me a long time to try one but its very good. Nice if want a quick snack but not really enough to fill you if your hungry.</value><value>Love these small Mac and cheese cups. Easy and super affordable. Cute and small for on the go snack and meals for kids or for lunch. Easy to use and microwave friendly. Would recommend and would always buy again!</value><value>Great for hangovers lol.  Easy to mak and kits the spot plus you dont have to make a box only what you need. Make sure it's the original because the different shapes one are nasty</value><value>When Im busy and I dont have time to make lunch or just too lazy to, I often just take a pack of krafts mac n cheese with me for a quick lunch, its affordable and simple to make. I always keep a few at home.</value><value>Eating this as a kid, its amazing. But as an adult, its not so great. You can definitely tell its fake and its honestly disgusting to me. I think the brand is great, but just not for me.</value><value>If your looking for the box flavor this is much more dull sorry its true but its quick on the go and more creamy in a way I personally love. Less cheese forward than boxed.</value><value>I buy these for my grandson who refuses to eat any other kind of Mac and cheese. I personally do not like the way the noodles cook, but if grandmas baby wants it, he gets it.</value><value>These are the perfect portion size for lunch or to split between 2 toddlers. The cup has a visual to help you know when to stop adding water. Too much water can cause the noodles to be undercooked. Price is reasonable. Definitely recommend.</value><value>This Mac and cheese is easy to prepare and tastes amazing. The noodles taste great the cheese tastes great and the product is very affordable. This product is probably not healthy but I love this product and buy it often.</value><value>This product is great for college students. When you dont like the dining food center food it is a great option to just through tin the microwave will doing homework. Also it tastes great!</value><value>This is good and good for a small snack. I only like my mac n cheese with stuff in it and a lot of seasoning. It is easy to prepare just add water and microwave.</value><value>This is what my children request to each every single day. I occasionally will indulge myself. They are super convenient to make in a hurry. They are pretty tasty, especially when you add some salt and pepper!</value><value>I dont think I need to really share my opinion on this...everyone knows Kraft Mac and Cheese. These containers are convenient and not terribly unhealthy, and are perfect when I need a quick and comforting meal in a pinch.</value><value>These are a go to when Im feeling like a nice snack. Very cheesy and creamy. Fast and easy to prepare as well. Am buying again. Very affordable for me.</value><value>I make my own vegan version now but I would constantly get this as it is very fast to make. Get in if always on a hurry and you love cheese. It doesn't last much on the fridge so eat it soon.</value><value>My boys love to snack on this after school, and its very easy to make in the microwave.Its the best flavor macaroni from the stores.I always have them at home.</value></reviewer_comment><reviewed_date><value>December 11, 2019</value><value>December 3, 2019</value><value>December 4, 2019</value><value>November 1, 2019</value><value>September 4, 2019</value><value>October 3, 2019</value><value>December 8, 2019</value><value>December 18, 2019</value><value>December 18, 2019</value><value>December 11, 2019</value><value>December 23, 2019</value><value>December 7, 2019</value><value>November 29, 2019</value><value>December 11, 2019</value><value>November 19, 2019</value><value>December 3, 2019</value><value>September 2, 2019</value><value>November 26, 2019</value><value>December 17, 2019</value><value>December 9, 2019</value></reviewed_date></item>

Kraft Mac n cheese single servings are very cost efficient and actually lower in calories per serving than the ones that come in a single box without changing the great taste.</value><value>I buy these at times for a quick snack for my son when he gets home from school. I like them however they are a little too pricey for the amount. Also not very easy for someone young to make to much involved.</value><value>This is just an easy snack, lunch, and even dinner food item! It is fast and simple. Mac n cheese is always fun to eat and if you want, you can add stuff to it.</value><value>I love these!! They taste so good and theyre so easy to cook if you dont want to cook a whole meal. Just fill with water and pop it in the microwave for not too long and its amazing in my opinion.</value><value>The kids always love this product..I prefer something with more organic ingredients but in a pinch, this works. Its so easy to make which really helps. Overall its more of a last minute option or something I keep around for baby sitters to prepare!</value><value>Although they made these cups to make things more convenient, I actually prefer the box. This is okay for work lunches but I dont find it ever cooks properly. Both times Ive made it I was super disappointed, I wont be buying them again!</value><value>Great to grab for a quick lunch when you are late or dont have anything else in the house. Good price for a box of 12 and they only take 3 minutes to cook</value><value>Not as good as the original, bit still pretty tasty! Super easy and quick! A great snack for the kids while they're waiting for dinner since it is such a small portion! Plus, the flavor and texture is still there!</value><value>Kraft Easy Mac is a very convenient way to make a macaroni snack. The directions are very easy to follow and the mac-n-cheese is very tasty. I recommend this product and will continue to purchase it.</value><value>Really good quick and easy snack or side! Personally I dont think its enough for a meal but its still really good tack onto one. Theyre pretty cheap too which is a plus. I have and will continue to repurchase!</value><value>I hate the cups of microwavable kraft. The cheese powder just doesn't seem the same and it can taste... Just weird. It's not like the big boxes you make on the stove. Try Velveeta instead.</value><value>I am probably going to have the most unpopular opinion because these are not good at all! The cheese favor I very powdery and clumpy. I do not see how people can live off these</value><value>Is there anything better than this? Though full of preservatives and completely artificial, its instantaneous satisfaction is one that cant be broken.</value><value>This is a great snack. I frequently purchase this product  My shelves are always stocked with this product. Its quick,convenient and affordable. I wouldnt change a thing</value><value>I use these for a quick and easy lunch. Compared to making the box all you have to do with these is fill with water and add the cheese pack. I love these and always have them in the pantry. Quick easy and yummy</value><value>I grew up eating this as a kid, and still find myself loving kraft Mac and cheese to this day! Sometimes Ill get such intense cravings for these that Ill go to the store just to get some. Kraft for the win!</value><value>My favorite quick little after work or school snack. The suggestion on water level for perfectly soft Noddles is a little low.

It's the perfect afterschool snack and is already in individual portions. This is great for kids that want it need to prepare their own food, especially since all you have to do is fill with water and press start on the microwave! I suggest eatting as soon as it's cool enough as tends to dry out faster than traditional mac n cheese.</value><value>My kids live off of your usual toddler-staples meals (chicken nuggets and Mac and cheese) so these individual servings are a life saver. popping these in the microwave and having a meal ready that doesnt make a mess to cook or take 10+ minutes of cooking/waiting is nice!</value><value>Do use are so easy to use. Theyre the best macaroni cups around. Cheesy, but not too cheesy. The noodles get cooked perfectly, in the perfect amount of time.  theres a really easy to bring to work or school. Or even just to have around the house for a snack.</value><value>It is not my necessary go to brand , I think everyone pretty much makes it the same . Except for velveeta.  I wouldn't buy that if they paid me to ...it is quick,  convenient,  I do add seasoning,  because I think its quite bland . My son loves it that way too.</value><value>I love these because theyre so convenient. You dont have to deal with making a big mess on the stove top anymore you just add water pop it in the microwave then add the cheese mix. Its also nice if youre on the go! You can take them anywhere which is nice because theyre very small.</value><value>These make a super quick and easy on the go lunch. They taste fine although don't taste as good as the normal kraft dinner of course. Not a great choice health wise, but will do in a pinch! They are also super cheap which is nice. Great for a high school lunch</value><value>Can't drop off snacks...order through WALMART and get free delivery over $50 order!</value><value>my kids love it and it is the perfect size for them</value><value>As all kraft products, this one is great also.</value><value>Very easy to make. Very delicious. Very tasty.

I really enjoyed this product. I gave two out of the four to my
daughter because her granddaughter loves Mac &amp; Cheese. Good buy.</value><value>I loveeeeeee easy Mac! First of all is there even better Mac and cheese than kraft Mac and cheese??? Secondly, I love how easy this is to make when you are in a rush and need something quick to eat or need to whip up a quick snack for your kids. This without fail is delicious every time. Highly recommend easy Mac!!</value><value>This easy to take with you any where..  It same as creamy and soft like the regular size..  It's so cheesy and the the pasta is so soft and not hard..  It also is a great size if you only want to eat something small..  I remember when I was in school I always eat one for my lunch</value><value>...i wish they had more inside the cups. Don't get me wrong, they are quicker and easier than the traditional way. Less messy for sure. For someone who really loves mac n cheese you almost have to heat up two at a time. The other little thing is sometimes they mix well and sometimes they come out a little watery. Solution: Before mixing the cheese you should just barely see water at the surface. If you see more than that just dump out some of the water to that measurement, then mix in the cheese.</value><value>I have read other reviews online and was iffy about buying this product but I have no regrets. I bought it in store and my toddler loves it. I doesn’t taste different from the ones you make on the stovetop. I added milk and water and I microwave it for 6 minutes. 3 and a half minutes didn’t work for me. And it came out creamy and nice, I also added slices of sausage and serve it to my son</value><value>This is yummy and easy to use for a quick meal. Its also very affordable which is great!</value><value>These are so easy for my kids to grab I love it. If you are a parent you need these.</value><value>As an adult, i like the spongebob ones better... but these suffice when im at college</value><value>I love these little individual cups they are the perfect serving for the kids and myself too</value><value>Max &amp; cheese like this is the best when youre packing lunch. Super simple. Super good.</value><value>Buy these at the time my son love to eat them and my oldest has them up at school for late night snacks</value><value>I’m broke and I eat this every night at college and it’s the best thing around. I wouldn’t have anything to eat for dinner if it wasn’t for this stuff.</value><value>it's great for when your on the go or in a rush. it's very simple just add water and microwave. Not going to lie it's not as good as the one you make in the stove.</value><value>My son enjoys it as a very occasional meal. Its great for those on the go days. I personally dont love them. The noodles are never consistent. Very inexpensive fast meal idea.</value><value>This is an easy product if you are looking for a snack or a quick lunch. Originally skeptical, I found once microwaved and the sauce mixed in that it had a nice flavour and consistency. I would buy it again.</value><value>Love love love! I mean its KD so a distinct creamy flavour you cannot miss! I use a little less water then instructed as I like a thicker creamy pasta. We eat this monthly and recommend others to get these small and convenient packs too!!</value><value>Nothing gets better than the blue box in a single, easy to make meal. These are great to carry around with you and you just add water and microwave. These are not expensive and easy to find. I would recommend these.</value><value>If you ever have a bad day, this cup of mac n cheese is sure to make it better. Instead of waiting 15 minutes for macaroni, you wait 4. Who doesnt love time management?</value><value>Always yummy, not too expensive and I like the portion so I dont eat a whole box. I like the box that has cauliflower added to it too though so you get some veggies without knowing it even. Always an easy go to food.</value><value>I like the Cheesy Made Easy. It tastes very good and, since I live alone, it makes just the right amount. Since I have a 1,200 watt microwave oven, I cook it at 60% power so there is enough water left to make the sauce.</value></reviewer_comment><reviewed_date><value>December 9, 2014</value><value>May 1, 2019</value><value>May 1, 2019</value><value>October 7, 2015</value><value>March 24, 2018</value><value>July 1, 2019</value><value>July 1, 2019</value><value>July 24, 2019</value><value>June 2, 2019</value><value>July 1, 2019</value><value>September 24, 2015</value><value>September 17, 2018</value><value>May 1, 2019</value><value>April 6, 2019</value><value>April 6, 2019</value><value>April 6, 2019</value><value>April 6, 2019</value><value>April 4, 2019</value><value>May 1, 2019</value><value>June 9, 2016</value></reviewed_date></item>

It does fill your hunger. Except some times the noodles will come out tough.. But the taste is not too bad for a quick microwave snack.</value><value>My kids love the tast of yhr easy mac original macaroni and cheese single servings. They bring them to school for an easy and quick lunch. The container hold just enough macaroni to keep them full until dinner time.</value><value>Loveeee these little mad and cheeses. There so quick and easy to pop in and out of the microwave. Wether your on the go or taking one for lunch. Its sure to never disappoint. I will always buy these.</value><value>My kids absolutely love these Mac and Cheese cups. Their so convenient and easy to make. It a great after school snack and I dont feel guilty about them eating it.</value><value>My great nephew enjoyed this item; however, one day he ate one and it made him very sick. Could have been the heat in combine nation with the Mac &amp; Cheese.</value><value>Quick and easy snack for 5 hungry kiddos! Great for toddlers all the way up through the teen years. Theyre very convenient and super easy to make. Also a good midnight snack for mommy I would most definitely buy again.</value><value>I love these little Mac and cheese cups . These are always available at my house so my kids can snack on. So easy and fast to make. Perfect for on the go on a busy day ! Maybe adding some more product in the cups will be awesome and more cheese</value><value>Yum! These cheesy cups are delicious, quick, and easy to prepare. These small cups have more cheese flavor then the larger dinner sized boxes. I wish Kraft just sold its cheese powder packet so that I can add more.</value><value>my friend and i for college would eat this. they are very affordable, and have a good flavor even though you make them super fast. they are very easy to prepare and instructions are clear. would buy again.</value><value>Is very tasty and easy to make. It only takes around 5-6 minutes to make. Also, it doesn't contain eggs, for those trying to avoid it.Overall, a very convenient product :)</value><value>These are great for on-the-go snacking or lunch (if you are near a microwave)! Easy to make in the microwave and you can add some vegetables or meat to make it more filling. Nice cheesy flavor and my family loves them!</value><value>For a quick and easy meal, this will work. However, convenience and ease do not always mean you will get the same flavor. This is definitely not even close to as good as regular kraft Mac and cheese.</value><value>I am going to try milk the next time I have one of these, because with the water, it was terrible. Maybe substituting water with milk will fix the problem. I was looking for a few good quick (non frozen) meals for days when I am not able to cook. This I won't purchase again.</value><value>I liked this and it was not too expensive.</value><value>Great fast snack for college life</value><value>Great item for my granddaughter when she visits!</value><value>I love this mac and cheese, it is great for taking to work, easy to heat up when you need the taste of comfort food.</value><value>These are a great easy snack for a lunch. Affordable and I purchase at Kroger. Just add water and youre good to go!</value><value>As long as u microwave it right it works. I enjoy it but it's only when I don't have anything else avail.its easy to use and eat.</value><value>Happy the online food purchase was not close to the expiration date like on different food web stores.</value></reviewer_comment><reviewed_date><value>February 27, 2015</value><value>April 5, 2019</value><value>May 1, 2019</value><value>May 14, 2015</value><value>September 13, 2015</value><value>April 4, 2019</value><value>May 1, 2019</value><value>April 5, 2019</value><value>April 4, 2019</value><value>March 24, 2018</value><value>May 1, 2019</value><value>May 1, 2019</value><value>December 30, 2015</value><value>September 28, 2015</value><value>December 8, 2015</value><value>December 11, 2015</value><value>April 4, 2019</value><value>May 1, 2019</value><value>May 1, 2019</value><value>July 24, 2018</value></reviewed_date></item>
